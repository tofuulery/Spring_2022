A company could easily set up a website and slap whatever kind of COA they want on distillate and products, and sell it with little repercussion. 

Make sure the company you're buying from isn't sketchy, regardless of the price. You can be buying whatever kind of substance scientists can create. 

If a company is doing a bunch of other sketchy practices, but their products are ""high quality"" and cheap, maybe consider that they may be doing something sketchy in that arena as well. 

There are plenty of high quality companies out there that are hellbent on doing things right, as well as the opposite. 

Companies I personally trust include 3Chi (+Skyhio), LulaCBD, Owl's Oil, GreatCBDShop, Harbor City Hemp, Delta Remedies, Hemp Hop, Triangle Trading Company, + Delta Effex (Savage).

Snapdragon Hemp is an honorable mention because of how transparent & innovative they are, but I can't fully vet them.

Them and my own company, Vape Whole Supply, are committed to providing people with a necessary service but above all we care about safety. Some vendors are out there to provide a safe, legal alternative while there will always be some shady actors just trying to make a quick buck. 

Be very careful when vetting a company and make sure they're doing everything right, not just the price and whatever the COA says, before you buy! You're ingesting this substance into your body at high concentrations! 

Stay safe out there folks!

EDIT again: their website says they accept returns but when I asked support they said their policy is they do not accept returns. 

----- 

I ordered from Buydelta8online back when their ounces first went up for $170. They took a whole fuckin week to ship out my order. And by the time they shipped mine, the price had dropped to $99!

Also as soon as it left Colorado the package was mysteriously held up, no fucking idea why but it's showing as ""in the system, arriving late"". I hope their packaging is discreet, though this point I doubt it and I've started to wonder if it got picked up. I swear if I get a CD because of this...

15,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fbefa733340>,,delta8,"Hey guys. This is a follow up post to my [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/comments/jawccv/was_cited_for_d8_thoughts/) one, wherein I didn't really give details unless asked, which didn't help anyone really. Especially because the one poster who was actually being helpful has deleted their account. Also I had went straight back to my CBD shop to buy some more because fuck the police and I probably cheefed like 1/4th that bitch so I was out of it. So here's my situation again, this time in full (maybe excessive) details. Apologies for the wall; this would be my first offense on anything so I'm peeved about this.

---
The ticket itself, the written citation is ""possible drug paraphernalia"". This charge could technically be true for a real asswipe of a judge, as the battery/pen/whatever I used to consume a store-purchased cartridge of Delta-8 THC could be used in exactly the same way to consume a Delta-9 THC cartridge. The difference here is that Delta-8 THC is a legal substance both federally and state.

As per Texas Health and Safety Code § 481.002(17): ""drug paraphernalia” is any equipment, product, or material that is used for the purpose of planting, cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, packaging, storing, consuming, or concealing a **controlled substance**. 

The police did search my vehicle and did not find any controlled substances. Only the single Delta-8 THC cartridge attached to its battery.

I have two problems here now.

First, proving what I had was legal. I have the receipt and packaging (from the CBD store I bought it from literally only 1.5 miles away). I know as a fact the officer would have seen this as he searched my vehicle. I think, though, they'll have to send it in to be thoroughly lab tested because the field drug test kit the officers had said it did have THC...and it did. The legal kind - but the test is either not robust enough/not new enough to distinguish the difference. Would there be any reason why they would not send it in for a lab test, and what could I do to fight that if they refused?

Secondly, how to argue that the battery I had was not paraphernalia because it was not being used to interact with a controlled substance nor could it have been used for that purpose due to my lack of possessing a controlled substance. In no sane world should I get charged for this.

---

I was initially approached due to being a ""suspicious vehicle"". I guess vehicles being parked in public parking at night - in a well lit lot - constitute as suspicious. Maybe not the greatest of ideas in retrospect. Awesome stuff at any rate for someone with a home life they're kinda trying to avoid but I digress. I had fallen asleep watching a show on my phone and was woken up to the officer's bright ass flashlight disorienting and slightly panicking me. Usual humdrum of ID and plate check and all that. I was kind of out of it, though due to having just woken up and in such a way. Then I was asked to step out and the officer performed a search, likely because I seemed intoxicated so that was his ""probable cause"". That was when he found my Delta-8 cartridge, confiscated it, and tested it.

I know it's a rule of thumb to not talk to police more than you have to, but I think I may have saved myself from being arrested. The officers on scene did not have a THC test kit on them so one of them had to drive back and retrieve one, which gave me time to apparently get some leniency from him because he noted that this could be grounds for an actual arrest. I knew the field test wouldn't have the correct result so I basically yacked his ear off about the 2018 Farm Bill and Texas' parallel state law and all that good stuff until the others returned. Once returned, they all had a properly lengthy group chat. I think they knew that I knew the law but they wanted to punk me out with something.

---

I think I have my bases covered here and am confident I don't even need a public defender here. I know the laws, I have proof this was purchased from a store in the same city, and a lab test will prove it's Delta-8. I do say public defender, though, instead of attorney because I'm not in a position to hire one. I had a misdemeanor years ago (my only offense ever, and since then expunged and should not show on records) and that public defender did a very poor job of helping me. With how much of a hassle that experience was, I have half a mind everyone was in cahoots and basically racketeering.

But as confident as I am, I want to hope that a public defender would get this case thrown out quicker than I could by myself and get this worry off my back. I have a clean(ed) record and I'm really not trying to smudge it by doing something legal.

**COOL STUFF**:


Enough of that, turns out phase one was so fruitful I was able to lower my price’s quite a bit. You can go check them out. What they identified here were different issues on materials used for packaging, lay out, and some other things. I am phasing this in but based on savings forecasting I went ahead and lowered prices to give that back to community. Phase two is in the hopper with the company and it won’t be as lucrative in savings but there may be some. Phase two gets a little deeper into things like a polishing after cleaning.




**SAFETY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE**:

 
I have planned as I grew to bring all COA test under one roof and I am there. No more relying on other COA’s. They are subject to fraud, being misrepresented, and other things. Thing is I run a restoration company which does pre 1935 hickory golf clubs. We have museum accounts, Historical Golf Country Clubs (don’t fool yourself these boys/girls smoke the weed), and personal clients.  We make these old clubs new for play or display. I also restore small old trucks like 80’s Toyota’s or 90’s Mazda trucks things like that. Our office used to handle all these COAs but with everyone independent now it falls on me.




Despite all that I have tried to recruit help. Of the first 4 people who claimed to be “experts” 3 just flat out flaked out and 1 tried to set me up. This wasted a lot of time BUT NOW I have a guy who is in da house! We have our first 5 samples OTW. We will have 5 more out soon. To start we will get cannabinoid tests so we can sort out hot products. Once done and we are happy with results we will send those in for full tests. We will be using different labs moving forward. We have a ways to go but it is finally actually started! When all said and done all COA’s will be ours, verifiable, and barcode ready. Stay tuned.




Now, with all the safety related to testing there are far many other things we focus on that we call “POST PRODUCT HANDLING” (PPH).  There is a lot here and I’ll develop this later moving forward. A few examples are things like micro fibers, plastics, and environment. Environment is a big deal maintaining a sterile operating base, protecting products from things like dust (other), and in terms of quality maintain practices so you don’t end up with a syringe full of terps and little product. We have many procedures to handle this and always trying to improve. If someone wants to chime in vendor or other please do.




Microfibers are a big deal especially if synthetic. In the process of cleaning and packaging material one or two little fibers on the end of a sticky cart/syringe may go unnoticed but cook it and that defeats the whole purpose of a clean product. We use scientific cleaning towels and lint free materials to assure we do not create a fiber play ground or that these things do not get everywhere. Sometimes what you don’t see can hurt you.




Plastics we absolutely avoid as possible. We will always use glass at our expense to help protect you. Plastics are very hard to get away from, but anyway we can we will. There are some “plastic” lid inserts they have proven inert to chemical reaction in the long term so good with those. We went to metal lids even though exposure is not direct they still look good and we can torque lids down for a good seal. 




There are plastic pieces at the end of the small glass syringes we use. We have tried the metal capped on the small syringes but they are unreliable and many have bad seals. The exposure here is limited but something we have given thought to. The large syringes do have the metal luer lock system and for the larger syringes they work well. So we will continue to use those exclusively on larger syringes. With the chemical compounds being put into the syringes we will not use plastic as we do not trust it. No need to risk chemical leaching with natural and terpene added mixes.




As with carts we are the same way. We do not offer carts on a retail basis yet, only wholesale orders on established accounts. Our carts are all glass and the highest quality on the market. When/If we do start offering carts retail we will spend the money on the quality cart in consideration of your safety. **We will see how things develop from here before moving forward on that**.


**THE FUTURE and forthcoming plans**:


So we are about to unleash a whole combination of mixes. Pictures are done, Pricing is done, and we are all set – EXCEPT my programmer is on vacation. He returns tonight so any day now. I’ll surprise ya and not let out any secrets but if it can be mixed it will be. We are working on upgrading our webpage and capability and hope in the future you can make your own mixes online in real time. But, I think I got the options for now pretty good. I will not be able to do flavors now with these mixes as it would create an exponential cluster. Later after getting the swing of things up to speed we should be able to.




In respect to D8 we have secured a few more distributors and we plan to offer different percentages of D8. We really like our guy as he is trustworthy and dedicated. We will continue to sell once run lower percentage always looking for the perfect blend whether it takes 60% or 80% or whatever. We want a product to hit the “mark” and satisfy those who want the highest percentage possible. Our new sources have different percentages in the 75% plus range and at prices I can pass good savings on to you. We should be very competitive NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES moving forward.




Finally as this is getting long our new webpage is getting close and this will keep the grassroots elements intact, but make it easier to navigate and clean it up a bit. We want a sharp image so somethings need to be attended to. Stay tuned!

22,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fbefa733340>,,delta8,"So we have been in the process/planning phase regarding a move about 170 miles away. Actually have not moved anything much, but planning has been ongoing now 6 weeks. It will be great when we surface on the other side - all else remaining equal. We are re-planting ourselves in the Rogue Valley of Oregon where I first moved in 1979 and lived some 20 years. 


I have not been here much trying to lay low. Seems I wake a sleeping dragon anytime I engage a shill or comment on ideas I have and business just gets slammed. Need to keep it at a solid predictable pace during this time. I have a large household to move and a few businesses and it will need to be done in several steps over the next 4-6 weeks - goal is before Christmas. 


You may see some products or product options not be available like they have been moving forward! We have started to let some things run out and this will continue for this time.  I have planned a menu and great super specials to introduce soon as the grunt work begins. They will be targeted to be streamlined, easy to process, and easy to package/ship. 


The location we will operate out of is being assembled as we speak and that should go quick, we will move household first, we will have some bouncing between places, and then the business will be moved. During this time we will maintain selling, but as mentioned above it will be streamlined. 


A lot of talk about product safety and such which is important, but one thing seems never talked about is post product handling. We have identified many details handling these products which can pose some risk to the customer if not handled correctly or things gets rushed. We won’t sacrifice our standards for income and until we can be 125% focused on some of the more detailed options we offer they will not be offered once they run out during the move. 


The great news is when settled there and rolling we have a whole new line up of stuff to be offered. Most all of them based on feedback presented to us targeted at several common popular customer requests. Being able to operate in real time there in the Rogue Valley with my many resources prices should go down and options go up. Things you would not even think about based on what I have been organizing already. It has just proven too hard to work between 170 miles, but with us being at ground zero and operating in this real time be excited what is to come.


I do not want to show my hand prematurely on these new options please don’t probe it is top secret! :) I WOULD recommend keeping an eye out here pretty shortly as we introduce the pre-move options. My time here will be limited so contact us direct at web if needed. This will be the best way.  I will make a few updates as things progress.

A Miami Beach woman is accused of speeding though the Florida Keys and flipping her middle fingers at a pursuing [Monroe County Sheriff’s Office](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241607956.html/video-embed/amp/miamiherald/241600331/1) deputy along the way.

Christine Eliza Dayoub, 36, faces multiple felony charges in the incident in which deputies say she reached speeds of up to 120 mph as she crossed the [iconic Seven Mile Bridge](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article229799964.html) Thursday night in a Mercedes-Benz.

It began around 7:40 p.m. when she passed a deputy in his patrol car heading south on U.S. 1 in the Middle Keys city of Marathon, according to the sheriff’s office. She swerved around him so abruptly that he had to slam on his brakes, police say.

The deputy turned on his lights and siren to try to get Dayoub to pull over. Instead, she accelerated, sticking her middle finger out the window. She passed other cars in the shoulder and even drove into oncoming traffic in the northbound lane to get away from the deputy, according to the sheriff’s office.

The deputy’s radar clocked her car at speeds up to 90 mph. The speed limit on U.S. 1 through Marathon ranges from 35 to 45 mph.

When Dayoub reached the Seven Mile Bridge, she stuck both middle fingers out of her sunroof as she sped across the span.

The deputy kept driving south, but he stopped pursuing her because the sheriff’s office has a no-chase policy for safety reasons. While staying behind Dayoub, the deputy watched her tailgate [a Tesla](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article230945733.html) and then bump into the back of the car, according to the sheriff’s office.

The Tesla began to fishtail, but the driver was able to regain control of the vehicle.

Deputies on the other side of the bridge set up strips of spikes to flatten the Mercedes’ tires at mile marker 35, but Dayoub pulled over a mile back.

The deputy who was following her approached the Mercedes with his pistol drawn demanding Dayoub get out of the car.

Monroe sheriff’s office spokesman Adam Linhardt said Dayoub laughed as she got out of the car and told the deputy to take her to jail, “adding she had no reason for driving the way she was driving.”

Dayoub also faces a charge of possession of synthetic marijuana because deputies say they found two marijuana vaping pens in the car.

As of Friday afternoon, she was in county jail with no bond information immediately available.",t2_3dzkprm3,False,,0,False,Total Florida(Wo)Man story here.

They forgot to reply to my emails or give me a tracking, so I was worried I got scammed. They eventually replied with tracking which was cool, I've had worse. They seem like good people who care about their customers and might just struggle with email sometimes. 

The package came with a hand written thank you note, skittles, and what I ordered. Great customer service there, I really liked the touch. However, this distillate smells like the clothes of a homeless bum who has been sleeping by a dumpster soaking in his own stale piss. The smell is very gross. The taste is very chemically, and leaves a pissy after taste in my throat. It feels like you are dabbing chemicals and not plant matter. The experience itself is great though. The first 2-5 minutes I hardly felt high, and felt like there was cbd all over my body with no mental presence although extremely relaxing and medicinal. And then boom, I got hit in the face with that amazing, usual dab high. This is definitely potent product, and I am already in love with delta 8 (that was my first dab of delta 8).

I am genuinley concerned about the smell and the taste. Literally everything about this vendor is nearly perfect other than this, the shipping time was very fast too.

It can take 2 weeks for full panel testing so I'm expecting them back then. But as anyone who's used our stuff knows, all our stuff is perfectly clean, just like our extracts are perfectly pure. The recent rush of questions all coming hot and heavy within such a short window just makes me think this whole thing was orchestrated for some reason, but regardless, we're answering the bell.

So why didn't we just do the tests in the first place? Because our inputs come tested free of pesticides, metals, etc. We don't use any of that stuff in our conversion processes so it's ultimately an unnecessary cost in terms of US verifying its safety. But we understand YOU want that, so we're getting it.

Ultimately, we have 2 years on the hemp/CBD side of things, and from doing trade shows and conventions we've met most of our retailers in person. So we've enjoyed the extra level of trust that comes from that and also just an extra level of trust within the CBD industry side of things in general. So if we could avoid doing an unnecessary $500 test and it ultimately resulted in cheaper prices to end consumers, we went with that option.

However, we're quickly learning there's absolutely zero consumer trust in the broader THC markets. Even though we've been selling Delta 8 for a while now, the first 7 months of selling Delta 8 we sold direct to hemp/CBD retailers. So we've only really been exposed to the THC crowds for a month and it is a different animal altogether.

So we're learning what the demands of the THC consumers are on the fly and adapting. We haven't hid from anything that's come up and won't start with this. We're in the business to help people and provide awesome, safe products, period. That's what we have done for 2 years and will continue to do for the years ahead.

So if we could avoid doing an unnecessary $500 test and it ultimately resulted in cheaper prices to end consumers, we went with that option.</p>

<p>However, we&#39;re quickly learning there&#39;s absolutely zero consumer trust in the broader THC markets. Even though we&#39;ve been selling Delta 8 for a while now, the first 7 months of selling Delta 8 we sold direct to hemp/CBD retailers. So we&#39;ve only really been exposed to the THC crowds for a month and it is a different animal altogether.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re learning what the demands of the THC consumers are on the fly and adapting. We haven&#39;t hid from anything that&#39;s come up and won&#39;t start with this. We&#39;re in the business to help people and provide awesome, safe products, period. That&#39;s what we have done for 2 years and will continue to do for the years ahead. And if getting these tests gets pure, safe products in the hands of needing people then we&#39;ll absolutely do it.</p>

As simple as that sounds, it won't be an easy task for any of them to achieve.

To simply put it without needing a giant wall of text, the guise of ""best interests"" or health and safety to us, the consumers should be an empty statement. I've only been a part of this community for around 3 months and I've seen a quick downfall of our trust towards our vendors (3chi credit card propaganda which was assuredly false and nothing to do with their product, and 10dc in general).

COAs and such tests in general are an absolute plus for our safety and key in showing transparency, but in a consumer point of view it's a sheet full of numbers that can be barely understood by a general mass of people, again relying on the empty statement that I mentioned of health and safety or best interests.

We are regular people trying to find recreation or medicine. Seeing this small fraction of the industry starting up strong, but taking big steps back is something I don't appreciate. It takes one domino to bring the entire line down. 

I believe this entire practice of ""trade secret"" in the industry should be abolished. Why bury knowledge to others when it can benefit the industry as a whole? This has been the biggest question I have asked ever since I started smoking cannabis. It makes people take shortcuts, shoot at the dartboard and see what sticks or works.

It makes people buy cheap distillate and package it in questionable carts that end up having adverse effects in our body, and that was not in any way a personal shot towards 10dc, the black market had left it's stain in our community before the issue with vitamin e and thickeners with metal leeching carts, and now it could be happening again.

I know I said I didn't want a wall of text, but playing with people's lives is no joke. Even if it's a new-experimental product to our body. There should be no secrets. If your technique is as pure and clean as you believe it is, share it with others. Don't let other companies take shortcuts. Scientists share hypotheses and work together to come up with the best solutions, why can't we? One SINGULAR product won't exist, because someone will always try to make it better. I don't want to see my cannabinoids locked up again because people don't have access to the correct techniques or equipment or chemicals or anything.

A lot of people are wondering whether vendors are using genuine CCell carts.  I appreciate  the way the mods have not only created a space where we can discuss and examine d8 safety, but have encouraged and supported safety related discussions.  A moderator facilitates, reviews, and guides discussions/debates and user posts/comments to ensure that all posts/comments are appropriate/follows Reddit “Terms of Service”/community rules.  It’s a thankless job subject to a lot of criticism. 

Anyone can invest in 1L of d8 distillate, carts/syringes/jars, along with nominal supplies and set up an online shop.  So how does a vendor source their CCell carts?  They likely source them one of two ways:  1.  An online search.  2.  Purchasing directly through an authorized CCell distributor. 

A quick Google search will result pages and pages of purchase options.  For example, you can purchase “CCell” carts from DHGate for 1.44-2.15/cart (minimum order of 20) with free shipping.  You are likely not going to receive genuine authentic CCell carts at that price point.  So vendors are either outright knowingly buying fake cartridges or the possibility of receiving fake cartridges hasn’t occurred to the vendor.  I tend to believe it’s the latter.  

There’s a total of four authorized CCell distributors: Jupiter Research, Kush Supply Co., 3win, and Cannabrand.  This means in order to ensure that you are actually purchasing CCell carts, you need to purchase directly from a distributor or from a credible retailer that has the appropriate supply chain purchasing documentation.  Each AUTHORIZED CCell distributor has their own cart authenticity “indicators” (engraving markings. 

A consumer purchases from a an authorized reseller. The reseller purchases from either one of the 4 authorized CCell distributors or from another authorized reseller that has purchased directly from an authorized CCell distributor or from another authorized reseller, and so on.

Big D8 fan here, I just wanted to bring something I've seen here before up since labs and their testing quality are on trial right now. I'm a soon-to-be analytical chemist and some of the test results I've seen are almost certainly companies trying to get away with low-quality distillate analysis.

When you are choosing a lab to test with or if you're a consumer and just got test results with a D8 order, please *please* check the LOQ. For those that don't know, LOQ stands for ""limit of quantification"", and without getting too detailed, is a number that represents the lowest measured value that can be detected with sufficient accuracy and precision. LOQ is very important, especially when you have a limit to how much of what you're measuring, for example a maximum safe benzene concentration.

If you ever see test results where the LOQ is *greater* than the safety limit, those results are useless. I saw a lab on here that had a lead test where the LOQ was *double* the safe limit, and the results were marked as ""PASS"" . That is not a pass, or at least it shouldn't be. What that result means is that even if the  lead levels were greater than the limit, there is a statistically unacceptable chance that their test would incorrectly say there is a safe amount of lead.

**TL;DR:** Vendors: if the lab you send samples to has an LOQ that is greater than the safety limit, please avoid that lab. Customers: if you see this, message your vendors and ask them to find another lab.
