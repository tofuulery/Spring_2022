Also if you dit know if it's legal or not, do you have an idea of how I could discovered it is?

Off-topic question: is there only cartridge and tincture or does delta8 hemp also exist?"

4,g6lksf,Delta-8 Product Safety,1,1587644160,"All,

With Delta8 being relatively new to the scene, there will undoubtedly be controversy and questions surrounding the product.  The goal of this community is to foster healthy discussion with facts, not wild speculation.

**A RANDOM ANONYMOUS FORUM IS NOT A CREDIBLE SOURCE,  PERIOD.**

If you have questions about how a product was manufactured or on the labs, CONTACT THE COMPANY to get a response.  

Delta-8 products are not plant natural and do require a chemical reaction, if the base extract is not 99% pure D8(not the final product, first extraction) than it was an unsafe reaction.  Many different acids could be used, ZnCl is probably the least safe to use."

6,g6z06o,Delta8 FAQ - **START HERE**,1,1587690256,"Welcome to the Delta8 sub.  We're dedicated to exploring hemp derived Delta-8 THC.  My goal of this sub is to provide an open forum to have civil discussion about delta8 and to share experiences.  Facts are presented and it is up to each consumer to decide if it is something they want to use or not.

**What is Delta8-THC?**

Delta-8 THC is a cousin compound to delta-9 THC.  Delta-9 is the THC that gets us ""high"" in cannabis.  A better description can be found on Leafly's website:  [https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-is-delta8-thc](https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-is-delta8-thc)

**Will Delta-8 get me ""high?""**

Sort of.  Users have explained it as being more ""stoned"" than ""high.""  It is much more of a body buzz without some of the anxiety/head-rush that is common with delta-9 THC cannabis.  There are also some medical benefits that are starting to be researched.  We're avoiding medical claims, so do your own research.

**Is Delta-8 THC legal?**

Due to the wording of the 2018 US Farm Bill, delta-8 THC is federally legal if ONLY derived from hemp.  A lawyer for one of the vendors provided [this](https://imgur.com/a/E1kObrC) letter.  Other vendors have similar language on their website.  Still, caution should be used when using these in public.  Similar to smoking hemp in public, while it is completely legal, a local LEO might not be able to or care to tell the difference between the legal product and its illegal cousin so you might end up with a ticket or being arrested.

There are several states that have passed hemp laws which specifically forbid delta-8.

**Where does delta-8 come from?**

Delta-8 does occur naturally in cannabis, but at very low percentages.  Therefore, the delta8 we are seeing in vape carts, tinctures, and edibles is isomerized from CBD.  This process involves adding an acid and heat to CBD.

**That sounds complicated, is it safe?**

Done correctly, yes.

**I noticed some of the vendors mentioned in this sub are on the** /r/cleancarts **fake brands to avoid list, what does this mean?**

 In the wake of the EVALI scare, /r/cleancarts has a very strict policy that \*any vendor without labs or a state license\* should be avoided.  This is a good policy, however it leaves no room for other vendors that operate in states that have no licensing authority to make appeals. The result, is some vendors may never be removed from that list if they can not produce a valid license. 

Until states or the federal government step in to require such regulations, this will likely continue to be an issue moving forward. This is something everyone should keep in mind. 

**So again, are the carts safe?**

 It is up to the consumer to make a full determination if they want to ingest or inhale a substance.  This sub is also working to root out nefarious vendors.  To date, several accusations have been made and refuted by the vendors themselves, knowledgeable people, and facts.  Each vendor provides labs on their products.  Additionally, some of the vendors have state licenses.  

If you have a question on the labs or the products, reach out the vendors and testing lab.  If something seems sketchy, there is a good chance it is.  Check this sub to see if there are additional answers.  

If you think a product is 100% unsafe, contact the vendor directly via phone to validate.  None of us want poison to be in these D8 products. 

We don't want to create a list of ""verified"" vendors, however, some vendors act more responsible than others.  If you search this sub for the vendor name you should be able to find out what you are looking for. 

**What other things should I be concerned about?**

The extraction and distillation process of CBD to delta-8 is the first step.  While some lab work is performed on the final product, it is important to also check the labs on the initial extract.  Lab work showing less than 99% of delta-8 on the EXTRACT should be suspicious.

Labs on the final product should also be scrutinized to ensure the total content of the cart is accounted for.  This includes additional cannabinoids added and terpenes.

If you have questions on these labs, contact the vendor or testing lab directly.

**What about the zinc chloride/bromide controversy?**

 A forum was found where an amateur chemist was trying to make D8 using an unsafe acid.  After the community reached out to several vendors, we discovered that it was a very poor choice of acid used to synthesize D8, and that there are several better ways, including a patented formula for generate D8. 

The user who made the original accusations has since deleted all his comments on this sub, archives can be found on creddit or other reddit archiving sites."

9,gaftbt,Delta 8 tincture report - Uh oh,1,1588188364,"Hey ya'll. I bought the 3chi tincture the other day, honestly I wanted the vape carts but those kind of scare me. I haven't smoked weed in years. So I guess I was excited that there was a way to experience it now without buying something illegal(in my state at least)! I had high hopes.

Here is my report:

**Day 1:**The first time I tried it, I only took a 1/4 of the dropper(20 MG/ML delta8). I thought I felt a little something but honestly, didn't notice too much.

**Day 2:** The second day I just tried a whole dropper full(20mg of delta8). To my disappointment I felt absolutely nothing again :/. I  was disappointed because I thought I wasted money. 

**Day 3:** Today I decided to try it again, I might as well because I paid a lot for this stuff. So I filled up the dropper all the way, actually a little more in there than last time, so maybe like 22 mg of delta8. Welp. I wait 2 hours and still nothing yet again,  screw this stuff, weak ass shit. 2.5 hours past, and my legs feel weak, strange because I didn't do leg lifts recently. Thats weird haha I must have jus....oh no. My arms feel heavy too, why does this music in headset sound like that. I am like 3.5 hours into it now and I gotta say, I am pretty fucking high hahahahahahah, I guess to get edibles to work you just gotta talk shit on them. This is pretty great!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Effects I am feeling:** (Re-reading this I realize it sounds stupid, but hopefully that gives you an idea of what I am feeling since it is hard to explain some of these feelings.)

very heavy body, noticed hands felt chilly, music sounds amazing, accidentally focused on a few sounds, perhaps very slight amount of paranoia, you can definitely tell I am high from looking at my eyes, definitely effect on consciousness as well. When I close my eyes with music on its like the music is the only thing I sense. Wow I actually feel high, lmao gonna not waste it writing this. Gonna listen to some more music and be happy, feel free to comment a song to listen to while high."
10,gano9p,Delta8 Compared To Delta9 - Dosage Strength,1,1588215584,Read a few posts where it seems like Delta8 is a bit weaker than Delta9.  About 75% the strength from what I gather.. i.e. 20mg of Delta9 feels like 15mg of Delta8.  Is this accurate?
11,gbs880,Converting CBD to Delta8/Delta9-THC,1,1588373278,"With hemp farmers sitting on so much biomass right now, there's an easy solution for the end user converting CBD to Delta8 or Delta9-THC. It uses an acid to isomerize CBD to create something psychoactive from legal materials. I'm not going to drop links, but search for ""CBD Isomerization"". 

It can be done in the lab or your kitchen depending on your budget or access to equipment and chemicals. The methanol, sulfuric acid, ether, sodium hydroxide method work well. If you like a Delta8/9 mix with CBD, Everclear with 0.05% in a reflux still works. 

Do you have any experience converting CBD to D8/D9-THC?"

13,ge9obv,Completely new to Delta8,4,1588724813,"Hey y’all, 

So Delta8 looks awesome, but I got two questions I can’t seem to find answers to anywhere. 

First off, has anyone passed or failed a drug test after/while using a delta8 product? I’d love to try it but am subject to post accident testing at work. It’s better than random testing, but given how stupid some people are on the roads, it may as well be random just with better odds. 

Second, has anyone ever experienced any paranoia while using a delta8 product. I know too much delta9 tends to freak me out as I’ve gotten older and if delta8 can give me the euphoria without that, I’m 100% sold. 

Any help anyone can give any info it’s be much appreciated!"

16,gi38x0,3Chi delta8 carts: Jack Herer and GSC Review,3,1589254456,"My partner and I ordered two carts to share and try out. I know everyone and their brother ordered carts from 3Chi as soon as they heard about delta8 THC being available legally, so I figured I'd share our day one thoughts and experiences.

The taste of the terpenes isn't overly strong/powerful in either cart. I was worried about an artificial taste but they're both pretty okay. Neither are my favorite cart I've had in terms of taste but that's a high bar. It's a pretty smooth hit but it still makes both of us cough more than your average delta9 cart. 

The effects of the carts is what we're all here for though. And that is very comparable to a delta9 high. My partner says that he finds it heady and cerebral while still remaining self aware. He says it is good for background radiation anxiety, so it's helpful for his anxiety disorder. Relaxed but alert. He's been mostly using the Jack Herer and is really enjoying the effects but not the taste.

I use a mix of CBD and THC daily for pain, muscle spasms, and headaches. Delta8 definitely helped my pain and the headache I woke up with. I have yet to find anything as effective for muscle spasms as your typical indica THC flower, though some CBD flower has come close. This cart definitely doesn't couch lock me the way an indica flower usually does though, so it might be a good daytime use option. The high is pretty good for relaxing and enjoying weird sci-fi movies or playing video games. I feel clear headed enough to read or work if I want to too, though. So, a good balanced high. lol

All in all, it may not be perfect for everybody but it's certainly a boon to anyone who needs a legal source of relief or relaxation. My partner and I both agree delta8 is the perfect stepping stone between delta9 and CBD. We'll both purchase from 3Chi again, most likely. I'm excited for future development of delta8 based resources/products. Delta8 definitely has a ton of potential to do good medically and recreationally as long as it doesn't become illegal in any more places."

These two metabolites seem to play a large role in the experience when consuming the cannabinoid, and it's very intriguing. For the past hour I've been scouring the internet to find any other information regarding the major metabolites of this substance, how they compare to Delta 9 THC and *if* there could be a chance of them running undetected in any drug test, but there's not much to be found. If anybody has some information they would like to share, please do! 

Also, related to the topic, if anybody has found themselves in a position where they had to take a dip drug test after using Delta8-THC or is willing to donate some of their time to make a post about it, it would be greatly appreciated. The resurfacing of this compound is amazing, I can't begin to imagine what the next few months have in store for the booming hemp industry.

23,glfwaz,Vendor Breakdown,1,1589724195,"As a MOD, I try to be as impartial as possible when it comes to Δ⁸ vendors.  I do not want to create a ""verified"" vendor list, a ""reputable vendor list, or a ""vendors to avoid"" list.  I have always encouraged discovery and research for each of the vendors so that consumers can decide for themselves whether they want to purchase the products or not.

With that in mind, I have decided to create a list of currently known hemp derived Δ⁸ vendors.  This list will only contain \*\*facts\*\* on each vendor that are verifiable by anyone.  The website is now live and available on the wiki: [https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/wiki/index/vendor-breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/wiki/index/vendor-breakdown)

This list is not set in stone, as new information and vendors become available.  In order to make this list, a vendor must:

* Currently have D8 products for sale
* D8 products must be hemp-derived
* Not be a reseller or have white-labeled products from another vendor that has retail product available

I'm trying to capture original sources of product that are not wholesalers.  Some of the information I had to gather myself, which unfortunately means it is not all publicly verifiable(I had to contact a vendor to get labs, for example).

If you come across new vendors, or new information that updates/changes what we have on the wiki, please let us know.  I'm striving to keep the list as impartial and accurate as possible.  No conjecture, no ""reputation"", just the cold-hard facts."
