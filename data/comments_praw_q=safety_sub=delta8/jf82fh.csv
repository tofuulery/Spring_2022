Sorry, had to get that off my chest. I used to live in Texas and it's the most ass backwards judicial system ever unless you're in Travis county.

 Now onto the good news, if you can get a lawyer, this case will get smashed. Essentially what is going on in Texas is that the DA and their local labs are too cheap to get real tests. Your lawyer will basically reem them a new asshole about testing it for delta 8 and they'll end up just dropping it and citing you a civil ticket.

So many hemp cases are clogging the system that they literally just don't have the man power or time. Good news for you, they'll just end up throwing it or citing you. Just don't use a public defender, also for future advice, DO NOT EVER TALK TO THE COPS. Their whole shitty job and mission is to get you to say some dumb shit and prove you're guilty. 

Here's what to do in the future if you're pulled over or approached by the cops.

1. Why was I pulled over/approached?

2. I'm not discussing my day.

3. Am I being detained or am I free to go?

I would contact your local NORML and go from there. It's possible they could recommend someone who can take your case pro bono or for a reduced fee. 

A public defender isn't going to have time to do a deep dive into the differences between D8 and D9, hemp laws, or the farm bill. Unless there was something blatantly illegal about the search or seizure, a PD is going push you to cut a deal that will include a fine and probation, which you definitely don't want. 

Without an attorney the prosecutor will bring the results of the field THC test and an affidavit from the cop to court, and the judge will likely buy it. There is a procedure for challenging evidence in court (or ahead of trial) and forcing the prosecution to prove their case. Bringing your receipt and a print out of the farm bill isn't going to be enough. It's not impossible to get someone reasonable in the prosecutor's office who is willing to listen and look at your case objectively, but it's highly unlikely. 

The odds of you getting out of this without an attorney are very slim. It's an unfortunate reality of our justice system.
