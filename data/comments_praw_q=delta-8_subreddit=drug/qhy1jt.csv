10,hqpv3cs,t3_qhy1jt,foolishJaskier,"This!!! I've been looking for something like this since my experience last night.

Haven't smoked in a couple months, when I did it wasn't a big deal and there was a gap between the last time I smoked and the time before that. It wasn't so much that I was sad and paranoid, but it was enough to be high and toned down. But the gummies I ate last night? Fucking terrifying. I did take like 150 mg like a lunatic but I don't think that with normal weed I would've been screaming, wiggling constantly, and convinced that what was happening around me wasn't real with that same dosage. Shit with how much I smoked total last time, it was probably around the same dosage by the end it was just spread out and an inhalent. And all I wanted was a bit of a high and to sleep. I didn't sleep, I feel like I'm eating my tongue every time I eat, and I drank so much water in 2 hours that I wrecked my bathroom with vomit. This shit isn't weed lite. If it was, I wouldn't have been lost in my own house because I was continuously walking up and down my basement steps and I wouldn't have scratched my chest and neck raw from being so aware of them and touching them.

From what I've gathered online, some people just have bad reactions like us. The dosage seems to REALLY matter, too much and you're more likely to be completely fucked up (like me). And it's not really regulated well since it doesn't need to be FDA approved in order to be sold. The ingredients on the label, if there is a label, could just be completely wrong. I'm going to look at the comments a bit more, but from what I've already seen it seems like you were told that you haven't used for a while and got really high and needed to just chill out. And I just wanted to make sure you know that's not necessarily the case. I felt very similar to what you described in your post and I thought I was going to die from a stroke or something, and I've only ever used once every couple of months.
