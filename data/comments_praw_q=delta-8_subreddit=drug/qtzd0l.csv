2,hkmxqwp,t3_qtzd0l,Mrhighass,Delta 8 doesn’t have to be produced through a chemical process as it is not synthetic and is contained by certain strains of the cannabis plant. The only legit “chemical process” involved is short path distillation which isn’t a “chemical process” so much as just an extraction method. Don’t get me wrong maybe crackheads are synthesizing delta 8 some where but it’s easier to extract it from the plant. Spd is basically dissolving cannabinoids in alcohol then distilling the cannabinoids out of the alcohol. Nothing too “chemical process” there. In an illegal illegitimate market a “delta 8” product could actually just be synthetic cannabinoids tho. There’s a chance your smoking synthetic cannabinoids under the impression that it’s delta 8. That’s why I don’t touch delta 8 unless it’s from a dispo and has test results. In an illegal market any “delta 8” could just be fart water due to the lack of mandatory testing. Some legit dispos in ok store their delta 8 and cbd up in the lobby so none card holders and buy it without the dispo breaking laws. You can also apply for an out of state medical card being from Texas,1,1636924186.0,,False,/r/Drugs/comments/qtzd0l/delta_8_experience_in_texas/hkmxqwp/,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fe89cf18d30>,qtzd0l,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fe89b25e040>,t5_2qh7l,,False,,[],,,text,0,Drugs,,,[],False,,,0,False,,True,False,True,t2_3ik8ckh4,,,[],False,1636924497.0,,,t1_hkmxqwp,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Delta 8 doesn’t have to be produced through a chemical process as it is not synthetic and is contained by certain strains of the cannabis plant.
