3,heb3cnw,t3_pvl68g,shmauggle,"I work for a smoke shop chain in the US and we carry a variety of delta 8 products. I‚Äôve tried just about everything and i‚Äôve found that delta 8 is far better for sleep than delta 9 as it doesn‚Äôt keep your brain awake while also relaxing your body making it easy to float off to sleep. I find that the most effective delta 8 products are edibles (like others mentioned) and flower. Now what makes the flower so effective is its actually CBD flower infused with delta 8 distillate. This is because delta 8 exists naturally in hemp plants but only in very small quantities so it has to he extracted from loads of hemp plants to obtain a useable or effective amount of delta 8. The flower utilizes something called the ‚Äúentourage effect‚Äù which is when multiple cannabinoids are present, they enhance one another a ton. So smoking a bowl of the flower will be far more effective than say hitting a delta 8 cart.

I‚Äôve found that the people who are most satisfied with delta 8 are those who either need help falling asleep or those who get anxious from smoking weed and want an alternative. 

And if you wanna get reeaaallly stoned, grind up some of that CBD/Delta 8 flower and mix it w regular delta 9 flower. Remember that ‚Äúentourage effect‚Äù thing? Mixing all three of those cannabinoids will have you on your ass.

Though delta 8 is far lighter in its effects than delta 9, it is possible to get absolutely fucked up from delta 8 alone. I once ate a bag of delta 8 dorritos dosed at 150mg thinking it would be no big deal and I was waayyyy too high for like 8-10 hours. 

Hope that helps, if anyone has any questions i‚Äôd be more than happy to answer üòÅ",3,1632630099.0,,False,/r/Drugs/comments/pvl68g/opinions_on_delta8_and_delta9/heb3cnw/,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fe89a196340>,pvl68g,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fe89b25e040>,t5_2qh7l,,False,,[],,,text,0,Drugs,,,[],False,,,0,False,,True,False,True,t2_ybs68,,,[],False,False,,,t1_heb3cnw,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I work for a smoke shop chain in the US and we carry a variety of delta 8 products.
