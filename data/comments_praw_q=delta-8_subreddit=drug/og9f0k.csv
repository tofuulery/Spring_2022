The reason spice became what it was is because THC-A was banned so companies had to create another bond to change it from THC-A. This happened over and over. Throughout time we got something even further from weed, while initially THC-A was really close and was not what you’d think of as spice. THC-8 could become spice if the chemical compounds were banned and companies decided to create chains to distance what they sell from the original compound, but with legalization rolling out, I don’t expect that to happen. THC-8 is something we aren’t used to consuming in such large quantities so id like to see some studies on how it effects people, but those will take time.

3,h9xhcr6,t3_og9f0k,Indiana303Love,"They have found these in different Delta9/standard cannabis items, as well. It bothers me that there are still businesses and companies that don’t care enough to have safer products and transparency. There is a vape shop I’ve gone to for 3 years near me, and the owner just started selling Delta8 maybe a little less than a year ago. 

He knows all the testing and production companies, and he provides lab test printouts on demand. He requires all of them have to have every test done. Microbes, potency, metals, mold, etc. If they don’t have them available to fax or hand to him asap, he doesn’t bother. He does the same with nicotine vape products. It’s pretty rad, actually. 

To answer your questions, for me personally, Delta8 gives a more productive high with a huge reduction in paranoia regardless of Indica, Sativa or Hybrid. I also have much less grogginess when I need to take higher doses than standard cannabis. Of course, I do pair it with CBD, CBN and CBG as this helps mediate paranoia and other unwanted effects. I don’t smoke anything anymore because the high is much harsher and it just plain hurts as well as being stinky. It’s easier for me to use it medicinally via edible, tincture, vape cartridge or concentrate.

I do think anytime Delta8 or 9 (they even have D10 now) is present, there should be a general breakdown of how to verify lab tests and also how to pair with other cannabinoids for the best effects. 

I do think that there needs to be some sort of mass testing requirement before business can even market their products. Like having metals, molds etc all tests available to that product should be required. Part of my reasoning for this is because there is a possibility of contamination at any step of production. Having all tests done ensures safety and a way to mediate any outside factors that could tamper with a consumable product.",2,1629652216.0,,False,/r/Drugs/comments/og9f0k/delta_8_thc_discussion/h9xhcr6/,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fe89c7e98b0>,og9f0k,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fe89b25e040>,t5_2qh7l,,False,,[],,,text,0,Drugs,,,[],False,,,0,True,,True,False,True,t2_2hmvb7ps,,,[],False,False,,,t1_h9xhcr6,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>They have found these in different Delta9/standard cannabis items, as well.
