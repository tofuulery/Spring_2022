1,hqvrxxl,t3_rtxg2b,Aboynamedrose,"Delta 8 and delta 9 are both pot. They're both active constituents of the cannabis plant. The difference is a matter of ratios. Typically the cannabis plant has a much higher ratio of delta 9 to delta 8. So you feel the delta 9 effects over the delta 8 effects.

Delta 8 isolated from delta 9 is... different. It still feels like pot but in my experience isn't nearly as anxiety inducing. It's shorter acting (about 3/5ths the length of the high IME) and has more of a body high.
