1,hhaoei2,t3_qbn02o,Mycelia_Universe,"Weed is a psychedelic narcotic. It’s psychedelic aspects are very weak and only usually occur for first timers/light weights and or insane doses of edibles/smoke. 
Some people do have mental breaks that can be caused by cannabis but if your not having that effect every time your good for most people they are just lightweights who over do it. 
Tips high sugar foods will help bring your high down and hot water/shower/bath.

It kinda sounds like you could be one of those people but also not. CBD is a anti psychotic and has shown to negate a lot of these effects in people who smoke THC and have disassociation/etc etc events. Your probably just a major lightweight who over did it way too much.

I later came to realise it was a weed induced panic attack that caused it.
