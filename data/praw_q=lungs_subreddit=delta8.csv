We just wanted to make a quick announcement that we ran out of our regular packaging and had to temporarily switch to tubes and mylar bags since we completely did not expect there to be this many customers. You can still expect the same great quality from the carts though!

We were expecting our Official cartridge boxes to arrive today but i was told by our manufacturer that it was delayed by a few days. Can't wait to share it with you all.

Again thank you for your patience with us as we worked  through our issues with the website crashing and emails not functioning properly over the weekend. We are going to come back with better products, better packaging, and hopefully a better experience.

We were really touched when a number of our patrons reached out to us to let us know how much delta-8 has helped them when things like chronic pain, anxiety depression.

I seriously felt the best I had in YEARS replacing those meds with solely d8. And it was awesome for about 3 months until I started getting some diarrhea type issues, but I assumed it was the coconut oil in my tinctures. Okay, switched to plain distillate but it didn’t help. 

Then one day it hit me like a freight train. A full on severe CHS episode. Constant vomiting, nausea so bad I couldn’t even drink water. I ended up in the hospital for a week over it. I have had one mild episode of CHS yeeeears ago with regular d9 flower and quit up until I used it to get off my meds recently. 

I’m okay now, still recovering from the nausea, especially upon waking up. But it has been about 2 weeks I believe since I left the hospital. 

Now I am back on a lower dose of pain meds and struggling to find something to help my severe anxiety again. I feel so defeated after thinking I found my miracle in d8. 

I don’t want this post to scare anyone away from d8, I think it is an absolutely amazing help for anyone who doesn’t get CHS.

I seriously felt the best I had in YEARS replacing those meds with solely d8. And it was awesome for about 3 months until I started getting some diarrhea type issues, but I assumed it was the coconut oil in my tinctures. Okay, switched to plain distillate but it didn’t help. </p>

<p>Then one day it hit me like a freight train. A full on severe CHS episode. Constant vomiting, nausea so bad I couldn’t even drink water. I ended up in the hospital for a week over it. I have had one mild episode of CHS yeeeears ago with regular d9 flower and quit up until I used it to get off my meds recently. </p>

<p>I’m okay now, still recovering from the nausea, especially upon waking up. But it has been about 2 weeks I believe since I left the hospital. </p>

<p>Now I am back on a lower dose of pain meds and struggling to find something to help my severe anxiety again. I feel so defeated after thinking I found my miracle in d8. </p>

<p>I don’t want this post to scare anyone away from d8, I think it is an absolutely amazing help for anyone who doesn’t get CHS.

Of course, after all this bs, I was nervous, as were a lot of people, about wether or not these carts were even legit. That’s what this review is for, but if you don’t care about the details, yes, they are legit. 

Shipping: I ordered last Saturday, and received it today. 6 days total.
When it arrived, it came in a regular white package with bubble wrap inside. Inside were my four carts, along with my receipt and notice to law enforcement.

Appearance: liquid is 100% clear. No pink oxidation. No purple poison. 

Taste: I ordered Strawnana, Blue Dream, Headband and Maui Cookies. Honestly, I can’t taste a difference between any of them. They all pretty much taste the same. They taste just like any street cart I ever had. It’s not a bad or good taste, so I’d give it a 3/5.

Potency: after trying all of these carts back to back, I’m sitting here smacked at a 10/10. No street cart has ever even gotten me this high. It should also be noted that I’ve been a daily smoker of delta 9 for about 3 years, so my tolerance is up there. 

I haven’t felt any irritation in my lungs, no headaches, nothing weird with my heart. I just feel high and content. 

I do want to note that I am NOT endorsing this dude or his product. Me personally, as great as these carts are, I will never place an order with him again just on his behavior alone. But a lot of people were worried about these carts being effective and legit, and thank goodness they are.

I decided to give 8Delta8 a go and purchased 4 carts from them. The day after I completed my order I started seeing all of the negative posts about 8D8 on this sub (sketchy labs, runny carts etc.). I decided to cancel my order. I placed my order last Monday and I sent multiple emails to them requesting to cancel my order, but received no response. Their website is very minimal; the only way to contact them is via email. No phone # is present on the site. My order finally ended up shipping last Friday. I figured I might as well test the product for you guys since it had already been shipped. Time to see if the negative reviews were valid.

The carts themselves appeared to be authentic ccells. The oil wasn't as watery as some users reported, but it was much more runny than MCH's disty. 8D8 oil will move around a little bit in the cart when turned upside down, while the MCH doesn't move at all. I decided to try out the mango kush flavor. The oil smelled amazing so I was optimistic... until I took a hit. Right away I could tell that they overdid it on the terpenes, it tasted like I was inhaling air freshener. Taking a hit off an 8D8 cart is literally like hitting cheap, fruit-flavored e-liquid. Overwhelming artificial fruit flavor and harsh on the lungs when trying to hold in the smoke. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they use PG or VG in their carts.

Now on to effects: I don't have a particularly high tolerance.  I take1-2 fat hits of MCH d8 everyday to get to a good level for a few hours. I took 7 hits of the 8d8 over the course of an hour and I still didn't get near the feeling that 1 hit of MCH gets me. I felt a slight body-high/couch-lock sensation from the 8d8 carts, but it was not enjoyable. After taking so many hits, I got a headache that I've yet to experience while using D8. Also, I felt a slight tightness in my chest. The only other time I've felt this is when I used to vape e-liquid years ago.

Overall, I would stay far away from 8delta8. Terrible customer service, and a disappointing product. Not to mention the sketchy labs/unknown contents. To make matters even worse, they are trying to charge $40 for a single cart lol. Save you the trouble and buy from a quality vendor.

About me and my company:
I am a 24yo college (last year) software developer that has been dabbling in the CBD/hemp game for a couple years now. I have spent this time learning, playing/R&D, and growing with very microscopic (Running at a massive loss) profits thus far. I, like many others, have been playing with hemp until the real thing is legal to work with. That is, until I got into the D8 game. I have spent the last 2 months tooling up, and going through countless iterations of R&D until I was finally happy with my end product. I have now gotten to shelf ready products that I am currently wholesaling to over 20 stores in my local area (east TN). Now that I am happy with the quality of my products, as well as the overwhelming local feedback that I have received on my products, I thought it was about high time that I exposed myself publicly on this subreddit. My company is Medicine Man Hemp Company, and we wholesale/retail high quality D8 products.

I know what you’re thinking, here’s another dude with shit D8 trying to make a buck. I get it. There’s a lot of D8 companies in the game, therefore there are a lot of selections to be made. I went about my product development in a different way. Instead of “how can I make the cheapest shit to make a buck” like SO many retailers have went, I decided to approach this endeavor with the mindset “I hate the current D8 products on the market. How can I put out a product that mitigates the negative aspects of current D8 products (too weak, too harsh, not pleasant) and instead put out a product that I (an incredibly picky Cannabis connoisseur) would enjoy using. I am happy to say that I no longer use any D9 containing products. I am happy using the D8 recipe that I have built over countless iterations. I know it is easy for me to tell people that my product is (fill in the blank) good, but my marketing approach thus far has been to skip the lip service and put the product in the hands of my customers (thus far it has been retailers and one off customers) and get their feedback of their experience with the product, and so far my feedback has been “I have not had a cart as smooth and flavorful as yours.”, “how did you get those gummies to taste that good, yet pack that much punch”, etc. I could go on, but I won’t because this is the internet, and everybody lies. My only claim to the quality of my product is that my retailers that I wholesale to run me to death because they constantly underorder and sell out almost immediately.

I know this is a wall of text, but I just wanted to formally reach out to the community to throw my hat into the ring. I am not some giant internet retailer that can compete with the big boys slinging crap product left and right to make a quick buck. I am simply a broke ass college student that spent his rent money and some minor investment money into several products that undeniably beat the products in my local market. I put out products that I, and MANY others choose over the current products in circulation.  If you would rather support a grass roots, local (as in small), company that is trying its best to compete with the 3 piece suits with Wall Street backing, I would be more than happy to help you out in your D8 endeavors. 

Since I know that carts are a major selling point for people, and I know that most of the D8 carts on the market are so harsh that they give you pain in the center of your lungs (been there, it’s painful and I know what it’s like), I would like to say that the carts that I have for sale are no more harsh than the D9/MMJ carts that some of us have had the pleasure of sampling. D8 carts without the burn is possible!! It just takes someone using quality products in their recipe!! I modeled my products after the quality products that Colorado and the other legal states are putting out, and I am pleased to say that I have gotten as close as I can to the real thing as possible while still remaining 100% legal. I have COAs on all of my products and I use good manufacturing principles in all of my production runs.

I apologize for the wall of text, I had a lot on my mind. Instead of making this just a giant shill post, I would also like to extend to the community an AMA on all things Cannabis. I will not say that I am an authority on the subject, but I will say that I have had countless hours researching white papers, forums, books, etc, and I would most definitely like to pass on what I know to those that are interested. 

To those that would like to pick my brain, here are my strong suit topics:
Extraction
Product development
Wholesaling products
Process engineering (what does it take to achieve X throughput)
Growing
Software development (know it’s not Cannabis, but I’m down to nerd out)
Any other area, if I don’t know it, I will research it and get you an answer.


Thanks for listening to my TedTalk.

D8 carts without the burn is possible!! It just takes someone using quality products in their recipe!! I modeled my products after the quality products that Colorado and the other legal states are putting out, and I am pleased to say that I have gotten as close as I can to the real thing as possible while still remaining 100% legal. I have COAs on all of my products and I use good manufacturing principles in all of my production runs.</p>

<p>I apologize for the wall of text, I had a lot on my mind. Instead of making this just a giant shill post, I would also like to extend to the community an AMA on all things Cannabis. I will not say that I am an authority on the subject, but I will say that I have had countless hours researching white papers, forums, books, etc, and I would most definitely like to pass on what I know to those that are interested. </p>

<p>To those that would like to pick my brain, here are my strong suit topics:
Extraction
Product development
Wholesaling products
Process engineering (what does it take to achieve X throughput)
Growing
Software development (know it’s not Cannabis, but I’m down to nerd out)
Any other area, if I don’t know it, I will research it and get you an answer.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to my TedTalk.

I saw someone on the guilded asking if MedicinalDreams was a legitimate vendor last week so I thought i'd figure out and order 2 of their carts.

&#x200B;

Packaging:Came in a regular black bubble envelope, discrete and just looks like a normal package. Inside of it was a sticker that I accidentally tore while opening the package and 2 tubes that had my carts. The zkittlez was labeled and the tube it was in had a sticker with the medicinaldreams logo on it and the sour diesel was just in a clear tube and both tubes had a bit of paper in it to prevent the carts from moving during transit.

&#x200B;

Shipping time: About a week

&#x200B;

Terpenes/Distillate: The only way I can describe the terpenes are artificial. If you like your carts to taste/smell like actual weed this definitely isn't for you, they aren't necessarily bad but you can tell they are botanical. I was impressed with the distillate. I got these carts on sale and it costed me $16 including tax+shipping for the pair and for that price these carts are for sure a steal.

&#x200B;

Also I know some people are probably turned off by how low the price is. If I notice any bad coughing, shortness of breathe, lung pain or any other signs of respiratory damage while using these carts ill be sure to let people know.

The first thing I'll address is the smell. There has been a lot of talk of pissy smelling disty, some going as far as to describe the odor as ""strong"".  Opening the jar to go in for a deep whiff was my first instinct and to my surprise the only thing I smell is a weak plastic scent that reminds me of the inside of an empty milk jug. When it's dabbed the smell is stronger but you don't really taste it, but more on that later.

2)""What Dat Look Like!?""
This stuff is thicc, roughly the consistency of their high percentage clear when they had that in stock (Please get it back!). After one hot water bath there is still quite a bit stuck on the sides, so much that at first I thought they ripped me off a little. This was made doubly worrysome as they once again failed to put any weights on my jar. As it settles naturally my jar looks more and more full.

3)""How Good Dat Smoke Be!?""
Taste: First I will address taste before I get to the part everybody actually cares about, mostly because it's short. There isn't much at all as far as taste, maybe a light plastic taste but it may be in my head.

Effects: The moment you were all waiting for, let me preface by saying I have a pretty high tolerance. I smoke first thing when I wake up for an hour straight, go to work for 8 hours where I don't smoke at all, then come home and chief hard for the next 5 hours at least. This stuff is easy on the lungs and effects were noticeable nearly immediately but we're weak for me, I've been puffing for nearly 40 minutes now and I've got a good sativa head high going on. Not much going on bodywise though. I've been reading more about CBG (and so should you) and I believe it would pair great with this and about 5% of your favorite sativa terpenes. It's great stuff on its own though, it's worth the $120 they're asking now if they ever get the site up again. Now, my only comparison is CC's 90-whatever% clear they had in October and a batch of Voldy's Brew. Speaking strictly about the effects I find this superior to both.

I went with Wedding Cake because its a top 5 strain of mine and when first hitting it (the back said 5 second hit) i admittedly coughed my lungs out, but didn't really feel any throat pain after or anything. The high was definitely a climb unlike d9 where for me i almost instantly get high. I would say there is 2 stages to this high. I personally felt the real high to last for about 25/30 minutes and then a lingering high for another 25/30 minutes. No more high at about the hour mark. After the first 30 minutes or so i personally also felt the high go in and out, like a wave almost. My head definitely felt down to earth as where with d9 it feels cloudy and such. Regarding anxiety, i didn't notice any while hitting it throughout the day.   


After the first few hits i decided to mix with d9 and it just seemed to increase the high more than anything and the head high came in when mixing them but it wasn't as intense as just doing d9.  I personally will just be sticking with D8 more.  


The part i'd have to complain about the most is the taste of it.

Packaging: Discreet & Fast!

I bought 7 honey sticks the Friday before last after reading all the glowing reviews on here and recently discovering Delta 8. My first Delta 8 cart experience was rough on the lungs and after the first few times it just wasn’t the same.

Snapdragons website was very easy to navigate and order from. I have to admit things not necessarily being labeled Delta 8 is a little confusing but once you realize Super Full Spectrum is what you want then your good to go.

First Night: I tried them out and started with just one of the sweetened Indica honey sticks. About an hour to an hour 1/2 after ingestion it started hitting me. All of my back pain was gone, my body felt amazing, and I was a very happy man. I definitely was a little sleepy but man the relaxation and buzz was a wonderful treat after not smoking herb for the last 6 months. I did get the munchies later and definitely overate but I can’t complain. I fell asleep about 4 hours in and woke up still feeling some of the effects it seemed. Overall great experience and they hit hard! Couldn’t wait for the next night!

Second Night: I took 2 of the honey sticks and once again I received the same benefits from the first night plus extra sleepiness. I didn’t overeat and took them earlier in the evening so I could experience it better and try to avoid the wake up still feeling buzzed experience. I will say I did still wake up feeling a little buzzed the next morning even after getting about 5 hours worth of fun that night. Wonderful experience again!

Conclusion: I enjoyed the other sticks throughout the week with similar effects and placed my second order last Friday which arrived today! This provided the best sleep I’ve had since my back 2 back surgeries 8 years ago and I’m so thankful for it! For the first time in months I slept all night without waking up hurting a single time! These honey sticks are amazing and a great alternative with what I consider better effects then vaping Delta-8! They last a good 5-6 hours from my experience unless you fall asleep on them which may drag them out some...well at least in my case. I loved my first experience with Snapdragon and highly recommend them and their products! They hit hard, have good prices, and seem very reputable.

I will provide a review of the 500mg Brownie and 40mg Mud Slide Cookies I received today after I’ve tried them out. I think the brownie is going to take me a few days because I’m not looking to go all in on that! Lol I also got a honey jar of the Sweetened Indica to enjoy since I used my other honey sticks.

I’m pretty sure it has to be the combination of 3Chi being extremely potent and the voltage on the Silo that made me cough. The high was enjoyable from 3Chi but the process of getting there was sometimes painful lol. You’ll see how this info is relevant to my review soon. 

Anyway, I decided to place an order for 10DC and the first I had to try was Cookies because I’m a huge fan of the actual strain. In addition, I paired it with my Vessel that I just ordered. I put the voltage at the lowest setting of 2.8 at first but it was really light so I went to the next setting of 3.2 and needless to say, it was perfect. With this particular cart, I didn’t cough at all. I’m not sure if that applies to the other 10DC carts but it’s really nice. For less money, 10DC did the exact same thing as 3Chi for me but without being harsh on my lungs. I’ve even tried my 3Chi Tangie cart with the Vessel at the lowest setting and it still managed to make me cough like crazy. My tolerance is high now but after a good 10 minute session with 10DC Cookies, I was fried. It was a really nice body high and at times I even felt myself space out but at the same time, my mind was incredibly clear - it was super relaxing.

So, if you’ve been lurking this sub and have considered indulging on Delta 8, I would highly recommend 10DC.

<p>So, if you’ve been lurking this sub and have considered indulging on Delta 8, I would highly recommend 10DC. Of course, 3Chi is still nice but their price point might be a little too high when 10DC is more than half its price and still does the same thing.</p>

I only took a single 3-second hit off the pen, and within 10 minutes I was good. It did have a pretty nice taste of grape and pine. I didn't get to taste it for long though, as I almost immediately began fighting my lungs to hold in the coughs (didn't want to wake up the whole house). 

The first thing I noticed was that I could not stop smiling, and probably found my favorite Youtubers WAY funnier than I normally do. I definitely felt the body buzz that sent me into blissful relaxation. As I was climbing higher and higher, I began to worry about the paranoia and psychological problems that arose with D9 which is why I stopped using it. I was almost expecting a bad trip, but nope. I just felt calm and safe the whole time. I have a fairly low tolerance, and even as strong as the body buzz was, my mind was pretty clear if not just a bit sleepy.

For reference, I have recently been using 750mg CBD carts from Farm Life. The best cbd I've tried, and by far the most potent. They use only cbd distillate and terpenes, and give a strong body buzz like most indicas. This felt very similar, just a little more psychoactive and needed less to get the same effect.

Overall, it's very similar to regular GPD in both taste and effect, and I'm very happy with how this experience turned out. Despite it being less potent than D9, one or two hits was really enough for me, and the effects were truly nearly indistinguishable from D9. The high came on quick in about 10 minutes and lasted at least an hour or two. The oil is also pretty thick as the bubble barely moves at all, so I know it will last a while. There's honestly nothing bad I can say about it. Will definitely try other strains soon, starting with Blue Dream.

I opened up the cartridge and took a dry hit just to get a taste for the terpenes and I found it to be a bit mellow and fruity. It's very similar taste-wise to the black market cartridges I used to buy, which certainly isn't a bad thing. I promised myself not to hit the cartridge before work, so I tried not to hit it until I get home from work (and boy am I happy I didn't hit it, going to work like this would have been a nightmare)

Anyways I came home, used a spliced wire cable's positive/negatives and plugged it into a 5V USB outlet (Dont judge me, you gotta do what you gotta do, I'll purchase a CCell Palm soon enough). I took my first hit, and it made my lungs feel a little agitated, which is to be expected. Me being the dumbass I am I didn't think to give it time to kick in first so I ended up taking 2 more 5 second hits.

That third hit made me lean over in misery waiting for the pain to go away. After my severe pain went away I got up and looked around paying attention to how I was feeling.

- Really dry mouth

I have a really high d9 tolerance. Been smoking flower for about a decade, more recently I’ve been using concentrates and edibles more. I use d9 pretty much morning to night every day. I’d say my tolerance is significantly higher than the average because when I take edibles, I can take around 200mg and still be pretty functional, compared to 8 or 9 years ago where a 50mg edible would have me falling asleep.

For starters, I didn’t expect d8 to work as well as it did considering my d9 tolerance. I was under the impression it was just a mild form of what I was used to. I got my first cart yesterday (3chi’s gelato) and didn’t smoke all morning to prepare for it. I was definitely impressed that it worked. I started to feel it after 2 rips and I felt almost as high as I normally feel off d9 after ripping it often for 20 minutes. I did have to hit it maybe 4 times more than I’d have hit my d9 live resin carts for a similar satisfaction. I also noticed I had to keep smoking it constantly for a so long to get to that point that I used more oil from this cart than I’ve ever used from a single cart in one night before. 

I’m about 24 hours in since first opening it. I decided not to use any d9 till I finish this cart to experiment how that affects my tolerance. So far I’ve used a bit more than 25% of it in just 24 hours...my lungs are starting to regret that lol

Overall, my opinions are:
-that d8 is pretty fucking cool and definitely worth a try at the very least

-I can definitely see why some people would prefer this over d9, even in a legal state (not myself personally, love d9 too much lol)

-If you use d9 as much as I do or just like to feel high all day, don’t expect a d8 cart to last you nearly as long as a d9 cart would 


I live in a legal state and don’t have anxiety issues with d9, so for me I don’t think d8 will ever replace d9 in my preference. I fucking love d9 lol.

So first of all, a little context about me.  I’m no spring
chicken and have some physical and mental health issues (Diabetes, Asthma, Depression, Panic Attacks).  I also have a bad disk in my back, so I’m in pain a lot.  

I’ve been using hemp flower to treat these conditions with varying degrees of success.  Though I LOVE my Dynavap, I just really can’t vape that much anymore.  It’s just too hard on my lungs, even going through a WPA.  So, I’ve been primarily making an MCT oil with hemp (Kalbra’s 1lb Stormy Daniels biomass is astonishingly cheap, but also, well... it’s definitely biomass). Recently, I’ve discovered that what I’ve really been responding to has been the Delta 9 that you can coax out of that.  

Problem is, for the tolerance that I’ve built up, my MCT oil just isn’t potent enough without taking an insane amount (like 60ml of the stuff for a dose).   So that’s enough about me...

Enter Delta-8 and Star Thistle Ranch...

Shipping:  As we all are starting to discover, the good old, USPS is struggling during these times and it’s hard to know how fast things are going to be, but what I can say is that I ordered in the evening and EARLY the next morning, it shipped.  So STR is fast, and getting from there to me didn’t take that long either (shipped Thursday, received it Monday).  It was shipped in a padded yellow envelope and the contents had no smell whatsoever.  

Product Qualities:
The bottle is a 100ml bottle with a white label, clearly identifying what it contains -  1.5 gram of Delta 8 distillate, peppermint oil, and olive oil.  The oil is a nice amber color, seemingly what a nice olive oil would look like.  On cracking open the bottle, that’s all I could really smell - olive oil and peppermint.  I’ve tried this both sublingually and orally. I prefer to take it orally, (sublingual just doesn’t hit me the same way) so I put a little honey in a cup, put some hot water in, and my dose.  Stirred up, this is actually really tasty.  

Effects:
So, I’m not aiming to go to the moon but, edibles are kind of hard to dose out properly and are VERY SPEFIC to each individual.  What works for me will not be the same for you.  Hell, what worked for me yesterday may not even work for ME today.  

After having burnt through a 3Chi .5ml Green Crack (side note - bomb, fire, wow, etc...) cart in 4 days, I figured I probably have a pretty significant tolerance.  I started with 6 ml, which is roughly equivalent to 67mg of Delta 8.  This was about 5pm last night.  It was, as it turns out, a ‘recreational’ sized dose.  Woof.  Very altered head space, very nice body effects, and then when a dose like this sometimes goes bad and anxiety and panic starts to set in... I just calmed down.  It’s hard to describe, but it just smoothed out and put me in bed at 11pm completely relaxed and able to drift off to sleep.

Today, I learned my lesson and did a 3ml dose - roughly 34mg of Delta-8.  Completely energized, body buzzing, and easily able to work both in a social setting and on tasks that require concentration.  

All in all, this tincture feels like a life-saver.

Even with just 1 drop, it comes out harsh on the throat and lungs. I have to compensate by cranking my battery down to less than 3V.

I've been using the Delta Remedies 1:1 D8:CBD Distillate Cart w/ Craft Terpenes for a little over a week now, received it just before they ran into problems. This is exactly what I've been looking for since starting with CBD for anxiety. 

While I like 3Chi's Comfortably Numb a lot, it knocks me on my butt, so I'll save it for weekend nights. It seems that the CBN in the 3Chi doesn't tone down the D8 effects enough for me, so it's about as strong as a D8 only cart. The Delta Remedies cart (Gorilla Glue) is just right. The D8 relaxes me but the CBD balances it out and I'm way more functional than when I vape D8. At first, it seemed like I wasn't getting much of an effect at all, since I'm used to D8 wiping me out with 2 hits. I've since gotten used to it and adjusted the amount (4-5 hits) and it's just right.

A huge plus here is that it doesn't make me cough. 10DC and 3Chi carts make me feel like I'm hocking up a lung almost every time. No coughing with this at all.

I remarked on how it almost felt like I had added some high THC flower in, and delivered similar initial sensations minus the major thought changes.  It's been months since I've vaped or smoked hemp without high THC flower mixed in, so this surprised me.  I could tell that this feeling wouldn't last on it's own, as hemp by itself always used to lead me to re-dosing many times through the night.

I immediately switch over to a 3Chi cart and started inhaling not sure what to expect.  Well I did cough, and it did hurt a little, but it wasn't anything I found completely out of the ordinary.  I've had expensive dispensary carts from Seattle that made me cough almost as easily, I just had to adjust how hard I was pulling because it wasn't an issue until the exhale stage.  When I had the vapor in the my lungs I generally felt fine, and as if I could hold in it for really long if I chose to absorb as much as possible

I noticed that the terpenes had no flavor at all on the inhale, and only when exhaling could I taste them.  THIS aspect is very different from my experience with D9 cartridges.  Maybe it's just been that long, but I swear I always tasted D9 carts on the inhale at least a little.

I did 7-8 inhales total and put the cart down as it was coming on fast and I wasn't sure where I was headed.  I watched part of a movie by myself and everything settled down to exactly the same kind of experience I would have gotten from a mixture of high THCa flower mixed in with hemp.   I did think to myself about doing another session, but I felt sufficiently medicated for the night and ending up going to bed and sleeping quite well.  I honestly didn't notice a faster comedown vs D9 or not, but I will have to start earlier in the night for that to become apparent.  


I really can't point to any specific factors that were I a clueless noob, I couldn't have been fooled into thinking this was all a D9 experience.
