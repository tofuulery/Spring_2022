Don't fall for the lies on the forum.   Delta 8 is still totally legal and the DEA doesnt even have to legally know where the hell I even source my Delta 8...  Sorry to the honest mods.  Last post, but I think it's fair I actually ask to have a link to a .gov source saying this. I will donate you all my D8 now and never touch the product or say a damn word on this forum. No one thinks it's funny all the posts linking to different sites ""still selling d8""...   It's just a very controlled market by a few guys and discord.. I mean they are replying and downvoting and upvoting, but actually read the mods replies, they don't deny.   Really they are messing with a karma that is affecting 100s of peoples health for the better...   I wish whomever y'all are would realize just how shitty you really are.   Just as bad as the damn DEA at this point...    ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤£

Edit: My point is proven below..  Guaranteed..  and I'm not acting like an ass or trololololing.  This post deserves to be stickied right beside that law firms article that screwed with sales of D8 for the past 24 hours for many vendors who took it as honesty.  This is the main marketplace and breeding grounds of D8, in one week-2 weeks  this forum doubled in size and 100+ people had the same idea at once..  d8 products. Now the big guys r pulling strings with bullshit fear propoganda.
