Still a lot of questions about the whole process of how it’s made and what it contains but you can search the sub and find out more about that if you want. The carts are great imo. You don’t really get a different effect from indica and sativa with D8 but the terps definitely add flavor.  Lots of great vendors out there all depends on your budget. I also recommend edibles as they have strong effects very similar to d9 edibles. As far as shipping the vendors ship to most states and delta 8 is legal under the 2018 farm bill so you don’t have to worry about anything there.
