3,s0r36t,Gadget622,Doing Delta 8 nonstop for over a month made me experience existential dread on a scale I didn’t know was possible. And I’m so happy I did. (But don’t try it yourself),"I’m willing to have a conversation about this, and I’ll definitely talk to a professional about it. But I want to make my experience known so if anybody else reads it they can know it’s all going to be okay. Truly, no matter how hard it gets. You are okay.

Please for the love of God don’t let drugs consume your reality. You need, NEED your sober mind to keep you anchored so you can appreciate the amazing feelings that some drugs can give us. If you are almost never sober, then little fragments of what you know isn’t real begin to take a much more physical form in your mind. It’s good for you, but do NOT do it alone... like I did.

Okay, entertain the idea that you’ve just had a lot of THC like I had and you decide to take a trip into a wonderful new world you’d just discovered: the mind.

It’s a beautiful place, truly. It’s somewhere that very few beings have the privilege of exploring, and I couldn’t be more thankful for it. I had to swallow some hard red pills about myself and my insecurities that I wasn’t ready to take, but I’m glad that I did. I legitimately feel like a better person after using it a lot.

I kept doing this, and by myself. For multiple days. 

After a while, the thoughts that are originally bound to your subconscious can begin to make themselves known. But they are crafty, and will only make themselves apparent once you start to lose your grip. When they do that, they will push you down and pin you down.

Even though it’s all in your head, the impression some thoughts can leave on your mind make you think about how you’re a soul in a body. The implications of this knowledge are just something I could not live with. There are things I saw that I would swear have to be true if souls exist, and believe me when I say that you don’t want to know what those things are. It felt like I stared directly into the abyss, like I’d just found out that Eldritch beasts are not only real but are around us constantly. It began fucking with me in places I thought only I could reach.

But it’s true only as real as you make it. Your thoughts are real, but only for your own small pocket of reality. These monsters can’t affect anything that happens in the truly real world. But if you let them into your mind and don’t fight them off like the beasts they are, they will break you down and destroy you.

And, at the end of the day, these beasts are just constructs of your mind that are evolutionarily designed too keep you safe from physical harm. They obviously do not want you to die, because if that was the case then we would have never evolved to the point where we would even want to do that. It’s like going back in time to kill your grandpa.

I’m not a religious man, but this shook me to my core. I can’t explain it logically, but I could swear that something or someone saved my ass back there. It felt like I was going to be trapped in existential hell for the rest of my existence on this Earth, and I had squandered possibly the happiest existence I could have had for myself. If you’ve ever seen the play test episode of Black Mirror, the poor man at the end’s reactions felt like my own. I empathized with him in more ways than I ever wanted.

I’m back to reality (oh, there goes gravity), and man I have to say it’s great to be back. I have an amazing life, and I can’t wait to experience it with a smile on my face. I’m so blessed to have everything I have in my life and I want to make it apparent how gracious I am for everyone and everything around me.

I am, perhaps, incredibly lucky to have the mind that I have. I am a man of science and I try to apply logical reasoning to as many areas of my life as possible. Not just because I have fun doing it, but it’s legitimately useful. I’m not perfect because I’m only a humble meat puppet, but I’m doing my best and enjoying it.

I don’t have schizophrenia. I know none of these beasts are actually real and that none of them can hurt me. They’re simply heavily magnified manifestations of what’s going on inside of my head. They’re literally just neurons firing and nothing more. But they’re scary bugs that your mind can get infected with if you aren’t careful.

Again, I know that talking to a professional is the right option and I’m going to go through with it. I know there’s a lot here that I’m not seeing but need to, and I know it’ll be good for me to find out what that is. The mind is a complicated muscle, because where other muscles help you grip on to physical objects, your mind helps you grip on to what’s real. There be beasts lurking, and the only way they can hurt you is if you let them. So don’t.

I’ll stop here because this post is already long, but I really hope this was a good cautionary tale. Drugs can do some serious shit to your head. Always make sure you know where your life’s path is. If you go too far off trail, you can get lost. Seriously lost. 

Again, if there’s anything you feel could be added or that you want to add, please feel free to reach out. Im not a professional, but I’m your fellow man and I’m an open book. I’ll be perfectly okay if nobody reaches out, but if you do it will genuinely make my day.

Enjoy your life.

I used to smoke heavily on and off from 2017-2020 but for health reasons I quit (getting high would make me paranoid, sometimes a bit delusional, etc.). I also live in a weed-legal state so I am not worried about the legality of anything.

I miss it lowkey. I don't miss the high, cause towards the end of my smoking days it was pretty shitty, but the physical effects I felt were so nice.

My experiences regarding that have made me decide that I do not want to get high off of pot (or really anything) for the foreseeable future.

I don't want to smoke bud/carts/THC, I want to go a few steps down. I know Delta-9 is basically pot, with Delta-8 being extremely close to a pot high without actually smoking pot (according to some and a few friends of mine), and I know most CBD products are a hit or miss.

My friend gave me some CBD flower he had sitting in a jar in his basement for a year or two. It was really dry flower, but I smoked it and it was very relaxing. I had a nice head buzz but I did not get high whatsoever from it, which was exactly what I was looking for.

A local smoke shop did not have CBD flower, just the CBD gummies that were always a hit or miss for me; plus, taking a gummy isn't as fun as sparking up.

9,r7r7a3,gecot63542,"What are your thoughts on the federally legal, hemp-derived THC derivatives (Delta 8, etc)?","As you may or may not know, hemp and all hemp derived products were legalized by the US Federal Government under the 2018 Farm Bill.

What exactly is hemp? Hemp is defined under US Federal Law as cannabis plant material that consists of extremely little to zero Delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis that everyone associates with getting stoned.

According to the 2018 Farm Bill, any cannabis material that consists of less than 0.3% Delta-9-THC qualifies as ""hemp"", which is completely legal, while any cannabis material that consists of more than 0.3% Delta-9-THC is considered ""marijuana"", which is still a Schedule 1 illegal drug.

However, they overlooked one tiny little detail... Delta-9-THC is not the only cannabinoid that gets you high, and this bill essentially made ALL other cannabinoids (besides Delta-9-THC), completely LEGAL at the federal level... including other forms of THC!

So this means we now have a market for federally LEGAL, hemp-derived products which consist of these newly legal ""hemp-derived THC"" as they're often referred to. These cannabinoids occur naturally at very low levels in the cannabis plant, so to get more of them they synthesize them in labs, and then they either spray it onto dry CBD flower, or they make edibles and vapes out of them.

Here's a list of some of the ones I've read about:

* Delta-8-THC: This one is said to be about half as strong as standard Delta-9, and much, much less prone to causing anxiety and paranoia. Most famous and cheapest of these cannabinoids.

* Delta-10-THC: essentially the same idea is Delta-8, but even LESS stronger. Said to have more of an energizing effect, while Delta-8 has more of a calm/sleepy effect.

* HHC: about 70%-80% the strength of standard Delta-9, and has been speculated to be undetectable on drug tests (though I'd wait for more info on that before trying it out).

* THC-O: about 3 times stronger than standard Delta-9. Said to be able to give psychedelic effects similar to LSD or magic mushrooms.

* THC-P: One of newest and most expensive of these cannabinoids, said to be about 5-10 times stronger than Delta-9. Hits you on your ass on another level.

23,qf2a9f,unhingedbimbo,Effects of Delta 8 on mentally ill brains?,"sorry in advance this is a mess to read. i’ve been struggling to collect and share my thoughts clearly lately.

i’ve smoked weed before. a lot. no issues ever. i would smoke almost every night after work and feel absolutely fine.

since i was told delta 8 was “really weak weed” or whatever i assumed i could take the gummies every day, under or at recommended dose, like cbd, but no, i feel like my fucking brain is melting.

it’s legal in my state. idk why. has anyone with a brain already susceptible to mental breaks try this drug? because fuck. i feel like i’m losing my grasps on reality, even after i come down.

like i’ve lost touch with my friends because they’re constantly confused about what i’m trying to say and i am genuinely trying to make sense and i constantly don’t. it’s like trying to speak english in a room full of strictly chinese speakers. they have to go back in their memory to recall very forgotten about times where they were subjected to something similar to what i am saying, to vaguely understand what i might be talking about, and could still be a swing and a miss at that point

i also feel like i’ve had a total shift in personality, like worryingly big shift, like ‘did i get brain damage’ type. like i used to genuinely despise myself and now i think i’m a god. like i am invincible and perfect even though rationally i know i am not. i feel like a narcissist when previously i was very comfortable with hating myself or at most being indifferent, and also very uncomfortable with putting myself above anyone else. i don’t like this. i feel like i’ve devolved mentally, my rationality has somehow diminished. i feel susceptible to delusions like a leaf to the breeze. and i also feel like i make no sense and am speaking word salad half the time. i feel just like drowning in bad decisions, like drugs and nymphomanic sex, and the consequences will never catch up to me and if they did i wouldn’t be at fault even though none of that is true.

is this mania? i thought i only ever had depressive episodes and then when on my meds, just normal. if this is mania it feels awesome and scary and like something i will be ashamed of and regretting the actions of when i come down and i’m scared like i’m watching the plane spiral down to the concrete from the cockpit

made a new account because i also feel paranoid and justifiably so because i know people who read through these kinda subreddits.

is this shit regulated at all?? are there any studies on long term effects? because fuck.

25,osql0o,Vestbi,NEVER underestimate Delta-8. (150mg edible experience),"I got these 200mg delta 8 nerds rope edibles, they were quite cheap and were basically sold OTC. 

I have a pretty high tolerance and for too long have had the mindset of “eh I could handle anything, nothing at this point can get me “too high”” … how wrong i was. 

i ate 50mg the other night and was a bit high but nothing special, last night I was debating to either take 75mg (1/2) or just to eat the rest of it to get rid of it … I didn’t really think about what I was doing, I would never consciously take 150mg of edibles but for some reason my dumbass didn’t even once think about how much I was taking… 

keep in mind i have no edible tolerance, but i smoke daily (not sure if cross tolerance exists…) but i weigh 130lb so… this was a recipe for an ego death / overdose waiting to happen… 


Now the experience- an hour in i was significantly high, but nothing too crazy yet, somehow it still didn’t click with me that things were about to get very intense…

my girlfriend left and i was alone, 1.5 hours in and i started thinking “damn… this is a bit too much, ill stay up for a while and try and sleep it off soon…

30 minutes later I was out of control, full trip visuals and literally ego death levels of mental out of nowhere, I had to let go and accept it, luckily I have a lot of experience with bad trips and trip sitting… but this time nothing I could do was changing / helping my mental, it was only getting worse and worse. 

2-2.5 hours in- my entire body started uncontrollably spasing and cramping, every muscle in both my legs, arms, chest, **I couldnt breathe** and honestly it felt like I was about to have a heart attack… I called my trip buddy but he couldn’t do much, downstairs my ultra anti-drug parents were awake but I knew they couldnt help, and would only make things worse so I knew i couldn’t tell them / get help from them. 

2.5-3 hours the physical body pain was too much, it was clear to me at this point i undoubtedly knew I overdosed and NEEDED it to be over, my mental was equally destroyed as my physical body (and I was only getting higher and higher by the minute)…

I wasnt tired but I NEEDED it to stop, I laid down and just felt my body shutdown, i knew i wasnt dying as no one one has died from weed, but it was hell. 

Next thing i know i come to and its 6:30am, (10.5 hours after drop) and i was still significantly high. 
Back to bed, woke up again around 11:30 and was still slightly high, and very very fucked up. I felt like i had just tripped hard the night before (that day after a trip feeling) and had a rough day, but i was more than happy to be alive, not in trouble, and for that hellish experience to be over.

Plus I'm sober, work in a rehab, live with family and get drug tested. 

But I take cbd so I ordered a bunch from an online vendor. They threw in 3 free cbd gummies so I ate them all. An hour later I'm eating dinner with family and finished a massive plate then realized I'm still hungry so I went and bought another huge meal and 2 massive slices of cheesecake. I eat it all fast as fuck (I'm not a big eater so this is extremely uncharacteristic of me) then I slowly realize that as my dad tells a story, I'm low-key hallucinating it in my mind.

 I start giggling maniacally (my family is extremely straight edge btw) and suddenly I realize I'm high. But like, really high, and getting stronger by the second. I stumble into the bathroom and look in the mirror to see my eyes are red. red, red. Its official, I'm high. But I have no idea how or why. 

I excuse myself, feigning a headache and go to my room to lay down. What followed was some of the worst 4 hours of my life. I felt like I was dying, I was thinking about everything I ever did wrong, berating myself for flaws I don't even have, having an absolutely hellish trip that's stronger and darker than my worst mushroom trip. And I still have no idea why I'm so fucked up. 

I eventually realized the cbd gummies might have something to do with it so I message the vendor explaining the situation and they tell me they weren't cbd, they were 50mg delta-8 gummies. I didn't even know wtf delta-8 was, so I look it up and I'm fucking pissed. 50mg is a strong dose for someone with no tolerance, and I ate 3x that, and respond very very poorly to weed as it is. I was so furious. If I had been driving I could have killed someone, or I could have lost my job if I were drug tested that week, or would have been fired if I ate them before work. They didn't even label them. So that's the story of how I found out the hard way what delta-8 is, and to never eat unlabeled candy

32,qaydvj,Cosmic-Bro,"Can't control use of Delta 8, would quit but I'm an insomniac, & Delta 8 trumps all sleep aids","So, I cannot stop myself from vaping Delta 8 24/7. I don't seek it out when I don't have any, but cannot stop when I do. Discovered Delta 8 a month ago in a gas station, now have a 3 months supply of high Delta 8, low CBD distillate, make my own carts, & I smoke 1/2 a cart a day, 1/3 a cart on a good day.

I would trash it, but I 100%, absolutely cannot go to sleep without it. I've been professionally diagnosed with insomnia since 9th grade. And I have tried many nootropics/supplements (which I'll list at the bottom of the post). Even the heavy-hitters like Clonidine, Seroquel, Pregabalin, Gabapentin, & even Xanax struggle to put me to sleep. With the exception of Delta 8/weed, downers are my drug of choice as they give me energy & confidence! (Tread lightly experimenting with drugs.)

While it's fantastic Delta 8 puts me to sleep, it's the exact problem with my use of it -- I'm chronically lethargic, unmotivated, in-my-head, essentially bed-ridden. I have an addictive personality.

Since starting vaping Delta 8 I've been procrastinating even worse than normal & have been half as productive. I was doing great a month ago!

I've gotta change.

**And yes, I have abstained from THC for a year at my longest. So I'm not experiencing rebound insomnia from THC withdrawal. I actually broke this 1 year abstinence last month trying Delta 8.**

Gonna try locking it in my safe, only letting myself unlock it at the end of the day before showering when all I have to do is eat & sleep. See how that goes. And I MUST keep it at home, not bringing it with me to work or the gym. Will only bring it outside the house to vape with friends on special occasions.

I'm considering buying a time-lock safe.

Any advice is much appreciated! Hope all y'all are having a chill evening! ❤️

35,qcjghn,throwaway02072021,Thoughts on delta 8?,"Anyone here tried delta 8? What do you think of it? How does it compare to weed for you? Here’s my personal experience with it thus far:

I bought some 30mg. delta 8 sativa edibles from a nearby CBD store last week and tried one of them the same night. Took almost an hour and 15 minutes to really feel anything and even then, it was still kind of underwhelming. Drank a little hard liquor and ate a little food too which seemed to help some. By the end, it was fun enough but still not quite as strong as I was hoping for.

This past Saturday, my boyfriend and I tried them together. He’s not very used to edibles or even weed in general so I started him out with just half of one to avoid it being too much for him and I took two at once. An hour later, I felt it start to kick in for me and I found myself almost melting into the mattress of the bed while we watched “Free Guy” together. It was cool as fuck for a while with all of the bright, colorful video game elements and effects going on in it but while it was still very fun, I could barely remember even half of the movie because the rest was an absolute blur for me.

After it was over, we took a break and got up to go to the kitchen. My boyfriend asked me how I was feeling and I giggled and told him that I felt great but couldn’t walk too well. I asked him the same and he said that he actually didn’t feel very high. I felt bad because I thought he was during the movie so I gave him the other half of the edible he originally took and then we watched “Caddyshack.” Within probably less than half an hour, it hit him and we were both laughing our asses off. Even though I’ve seen it probably half a dozen times by now, I remembered even less of that one than “Free Guy” and couldn’t even predict what would happen next because I was so high at that point that my memory was barely even functioning anymore. After it was over, we were both exhausted so we fell asleep pretty quickly. The next morning, he said that he still felt kind of high but it wore off by noon iirc.

All in all, I found the effects of the delta 8 gummies to be almost identical to THC ones which was pretty nice. I read a couple articles discussing the differences between delta 8 and THC but personally, I didn’t really notice any. I’d definitely be down to try them again, that’s for sure.",1634790304.0,,Cannabinoids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/qcjghn/thoughts_on_delta_8/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_a15bejb7,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Cannabinoids'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Cannabinoids,0,,,False,t3_qcjghn,False,light,0.66,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Anyone here tried delta 8?

<p>After it was over, we took a break and got up to go to the kitchen. My boyfriend asked me how I was feeling and I giggled and told him that I felt great but couldn’t walk too well. I asked him the same and he said that he actually didn’t feel very high. I felt bad because I thought he was during the movie so I gave him the other half of the edible he originally took and then we watched “Caddyshack.” Within probably less than half an hour, it hit him and we were both laughing our asses off. Even though I’ve seen it probably half a dozen times by now, I remembered even less of that one than “Free Guy” and couldn’t even predict what would happen next because I was so high at that point that my memory was barely even functioning anymore. After it was over, we were both exhausted so we fell asleep pretty quickly. The next morning, he said that he still felt kind of high but it wore off by noon iirc.</p>

<p>All in all, I found the effects of the delta 8 gummies to be almost identical to THC ones which was pretty nice. I read a couple articles discussing the differences between delta 8 and THC but personally, I didn’t really notice any. I’d definitely be down to try them again, that’s for sure.</p>

55,posryp,CritcizeMe,Kush burst - Delta 8 - review,"Context: I am coming off of a 1 month tolerance break, so I am getting to experience these on a fresh intake. 

I took 150 mg (50 mg per) about 45 minutes ago. At the 25 minute mark I was feeling them heavy. Quick and heavy. 

Im not positive whether my tolerance had anything to do with that. Typically a D8 edible takes roughly 1-2 hours to take effect for me. It may also be the amount I took. Im a big dude 6-3 245 LBs. 

I want to emphasize how good these actually are. I am just where I want to be. Medium euphoria and a high that can be felt head to toe and continues to intensify going on the 45 minute mark. I’m in for the long haul. 

The taste is a good too. The Kush Burst come in various amount of flavors. From Peach - Sour apple. The texture is a little chewy but not too much to persist any complaints. Although a buddy of mine wasn’t a fan, though also enjoyed the flavor.

I highly recommend these dudes. Quick and heavy lift. I will edit later to detail the duration of the effects.

Granted I don’t smoke wax very much, especially out of a pen but it feels just like THC. I live in an illegal state too, I thought it wouldn’t be as good.

I did look up the brand and such while I was in the gas station, and read good stuff about the only brand they had… how much that plays a roll, I can’t say. 

I got an indica one, and it doesn’t necessarily feel couch locky. My store also has like CBD-N or thc -N ones with delta8, too high to remember which one it was without googling. 

It does feel like the smoke is heavier, which lead to a little cough but nothing crazy. Anxiety is definitely much better than THC, but I took a deceivingly big hit and am quite high which I don’t care for anymore. It overall feels more enjoyable than THC but I could see people liking to switch it up.

63,n8tnhm,throwawayokay196374,Delta 8 panic attack,"Hey all, I’m a fairly seasoned cannabis user, but rarely take edibles after having a bad, anxiety inducing experience on edibles. Even with smoking I do have to be careful as too high can enter anxiety territory for me, but I still smoke often for pain relief and to relax. I was recently staying with a friend who had a delta 8 cart as well as some gummies. We hit the cart off and on all night and it produced a nice, chill high. Before I went to bed I had a 25 mg gummy. I don’t usually do edibles for the reasons stated above but having heard delta 8 is much more chill I thought why not? 

I took it around midnight and woke up around 1 with waves of panic washing over me. There was a storm outside and I felt like the house was about to be hit by a tornado. I finally woke up from that sleepy panicked state to a full blown panic attack. Felt like I was having a heart attack, like I was dying, my body was wildly cycling between freezing cold and sweating. My muscles were twitching so bad I felt like I was seizing. I felt dissociated from my body and my mind was entirely unable to calm down my body. I knew I was tripping/having a panic attack but if my husband wasn’t right there to tell me over and over I’d be ok I genuinely feel like I would have called 911. I knew what was happening but the absolute FEAR and feeling that I was actively dying were unbelievably strong. My mouth was so dry it felt like a sponge out of water.

I also love how the experience is so different and will not be the same each time. Some things will be the same, though. I'll get the munchies, any muscle I don't move for long enough will get numbed, then paralyzed, then cease to exist, and music will have its own presence that will engulf me rather than just be sound.

My second time doing edibles (which is my first time eating a full gummy), I had a trip that felt like it was full of revelations. For example, our universe is a simulation (Sounds cliche, but that's how I felt that day) and underneath these human bodies, we are actually these fractal entities piloting the human body that we occupy till the day we die.

Another trip I had was more on the relaxing side. I felt like I was cuddling with the universe and it was pretty comforting.

During the Super Bowl, It was mostly sensual stimulation. Even though the Halftime show was below par according to many people, my high self was actually enjoying it in that I was in pure awe of what I saw that had I been sober, I would think it was the stupidest thing I had seen.

During the high that happened last Friday, I never felt so euphoric in my life! Like, I swear, I felt like I was flying during the experience! The music I did listen to mid-trip had lyrics that provided instant and automatic visualization that I didn't think about when sober. And what my brain produced from those lyrics was so beautiful! I felt like one of the singers was lifting me up into Heaven and I felt full-body bliss. What made it even more magical was that time slowed down slightly and made the songs feel longer than they actually are. I started asking myself, why is life so beautiful?

68,ny4fr3,postcooked_2,"Delta-8 THC, nicotine, and 710mg of caffeine in 14 hours while working doordash (2 bang energy 300mg/ea and 1 Bai boost 110mg)","Male, 19, 200lbs. 

Regular user of d9 and d8-THC

Regular vaper

Very rare caffeine user, no tolerance

Low sensitivity to most substances



I started my day at noon by getting ready to dash for as long as possible Friday night/Saturday morning. I went to Walgreens to pick up some caffeine. I had pretty broken sleep the night previous, so I needed some just to get off the ground and I got some for later for when the first dose wears off. I got 2 peach mango bang energys, which have 300mg of caffeine, creatine, CoQ10, and essential amino acids (the ones our bodies do not produce on their own).

1:30pm - pumping gas and sipping the first bang, readjusting to the world of the waking. After gas, I drive to a city 30 minutes over since dash is busier there. I listen to death grips and hit my delta-8 pen on the way and throughout the day.

2:00pm - by the time I get there, I start feeling a rush, or a push, that I haven't gotten from anything else except maybe Adderall. It felt like I had a crazy amount of energy being supplied from some electric field behind me. Listening to death grips' bubbles buried in this jungle while going 80mph on the freeway was pure dopamine. 

3:00pm - the amp carried through here, still juicin'. I noticed while walking into a restaurant that the physical exhaustion I'd been facing over the last few days was still present, but I moved through it like a hot knife through butter. I felt my soreness but it didn't impede me at all.

4:00pm - by now the initial push has leveled out a little to a low level adrenaline-like state, like when a cop is following you. My eyes are very open and my mind is very active.

5:00pm - I feel completely indistinguishable from having just had a good night's sleep. The energy level has gone back down to something just a bit more than average.

6:00pm - the push has completely dissipated but I'm still completely awake and alert, I enter sort of a groove for the next few hours

10:00pm - the crash from the first bang begins. My physical exhaustion becomes very apparent, just a perpetual feeling of having just lifted a refrigerator upstairs. I start yawning quite a bit. Normally when I feel this tired it gets hard to drive because my eyes will go out of focus, but they stayed in focus despite the tiredness which was a very pleasant surprise.

11:00pm - I take a short 30 minute rest while waiting for orders, but I don't fall asleep, just kind of breathe and lie there. 

11:30pm - I get my next order and begin drinking the second bang.

12:00am - I feel VERY awake, alarmingly aware. I'm pretty stoned off my d8 at this point, too, and it's dark country roads for this order so I get kinda paranoid. I feel my chest tighten a little bit, and I can feel every little thing on my skin. My clothes, the air, cords, hair. 

1:00am - listened to death grips' beware on the way back to town, had a brief glimpse of god mode. Similar to first rush just more intense, raw raw dopamine. This is what I imagine mania is like. I felt like I could split the earth 🌎

2:00am - sometime around here it had an unnoticeable transition to a very chill, dissociated state. My back pain was doing a lot better for some reason. The haze was only over my higher thinking, I was still very aware of my environment but the thoughts slowed to a crawl. 

3:00am - crashing very hard, stopped to buy more caffeine and gas to dash a little more and make it home.

3:30am - I drink a Bai boost while completing a final order and head home. Death grips at full volume is the only thing keeping me up. Even though I'm so crashed, my vision stayed clear and my other senses equally as sharp. Time was really stretched out, though. The 30 minute drive felt like 90. 

5:00am - I take a shower and I went back to feeling just fine, just like 5:00pm. 

6:00am - I just finished writing this report and I feel like I could start this day without any sleep, but I doubt I'll make it without a serious crash soon. I feel like I could easily fall asleep if I wanted to, too, I'm going to try.

<p>I started my day at noon by getting ready to dash for as long as possible Friday night/Saturday morning. I went to Walgreens to pick up some caffeine. I had pretty broken sleep the night previous, so I needed some just to get off the ground and I got some for later for when the first dose wears off. I got 2 peach mango bang energys, which have 300mg of caffeine, creatine, CoQ10, and essential amino acids (the ones our bodies do not produce on their own).</p>

<p>1:30pm - pumping gas and sipping the first bang, readjusting to the world of the waking. After gas, I drive to a city 30 minutes over since dash is busier there. I listen to death grips and hit my delta-8 pen on the way and throughout the day.</p>

<p>2:00pm - by the time I get there, I start feeling a rush, or a push, that I haven&#39;t gotten from anything else except maybe Adderall. It felt like I had a crazy amount of energy being supplied from some electric field behind me. Listening to death grips&#39; bubbles buried in this jungle while going 80mph on the freeway was pure dopamine. </p>

<p>3:00pm - the amp carried through here, still juicin&#39;. I noticed while walking into a restaurant that the physical exhaustion I&#39;d been facing over the last few days was still present, but I moved through it like a hot knife through butter. I felt my soreness but it didn&#39;t impede me at all.</p>

<p>4:00pm - by now the initial push has leveled out a little to a low level adrenaline-like state, like when a cop is following you. My eyes are very open and my mind is very active.</p>

<p>5:00pm - I feel completely indistinguishable from having just had a good night&#39;s sleep. The energy level has gone back down to something just a bit more than average.</p>

<p>6:00pm - the push has completely dissipated but I&#39;m still completely awake and alert, I enter sort of a groove for the next few hours</p>

<p>10:00pm - the crash from the first bang begins. My physical exhaustion becomes very apparent, just a perpetual feeling of having just lifted a refrigerator upstairs. I start yawning quite a bit. Normally when I feel this tired it gets hard to drive because my eyes will go out of focus, but they stayed in focus despite the tiredness which was a very pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>11:00pm - I take a short 30 minute rest while waiting for orders, but I don&#39;t fall asleep, just kind of breathe and lie there. </p>

71,lnt9o4,MercyMain42069,Don’t pass on Delta-8-THC (a review),"I wanted to be baked this weekend, so I bought traditional Delta-9 edibles but they hadn’t arrived yet, and the only real dispensary in my town was a place called Swin Dispensaries. It was completely legal and didn’t even require a medical card (you just have to be 21), because instead of delta-9 thc which you may be used to, it was delta-8. I drove 20 minutes there and back to get a bag of 16 edibles for 30$, each little gummy piece being 25 mg. I took two, my boyfriend took 1. We were using this an alternative to the edibles that were technically illegal without a medical card (which I have, though they were purchased not-so-legally).

The high took awhile to kick in. My 50mg dose that I’m currently on is giving me a light body high and the enchanted state of humor and increased enjoyment of things such as food, music and YouTube/movies that I often associate with the feeling of being high, and is likely my favorite aspect of a marijuana high.

People have said Delta-8 is a weaker high, and I agree. But it was still a high, and it is/was fun. I may need to double or triple my dose to feel higher, since I enjoy hella highs, you may want to use delta-8 thc if regular edibles always seem to hit you too hard, or if your regular weed dealer seems to not wanna answer his damn phone. I got mine at a federally legal dispensary, so if you have one near you that says “delta-8”, don’t pass on it, just because it’s something you don’t hear about a lot.

I have a friend who says edibles do absolutely nothing for him, and he’s had official dispensary edibles instead of homemade ones that may have all been made incorrectly. I’m no doctor, but my theory is that he and others like him (who get high from smoking but not edibles), have some sort of gene that lessens the absorption of delta-9-thc so it can only be smoked for them. But maybe delta 8 is still processed as an edible even with this gene, so they can try this. I’ll ask him about it.

Please note that my experience only comes from edibles, I have yet to smoke the delta-8 joint I also bought. I vastly prefer edibles to smoking. You get higher and your throat doesn’t hurt.

72,muujsx,Tylerb0713,I THINK delta 8 Thc stacks on top of the high from delta 9.,"Okay, hear me out. I know they’re kinda the same, but I’d swear on my soul, my tolerance to the delta 8 seems to be different, like a full blunt of good flower gives me a little buzz, but a couple rips of delta 8 (which is supposedly half as potent) gets me feeling pretty good. I have an extremely high tolerance, so I’m kinda just excited at all when I get high. 

Anyways, if I rip some herb, it feels like delta 8, either tincture or dabs or whatever, seems to just add right to it. The tolerance seems a bit different, as it might be efficient for your tolerance and longevity of weed to alternate delta 8 and delta 9. Maybe delta 8 during the day and the more potent at night? 

The delta 8 in general seems to have a more upbeat, uplifting feeling, even to someone who has a very high tolerance. 

Just my .02, figured I’d share in the spirit of 420! I certainly recommend trying some delta 8.

73,k2upc9,omeyz,I just discovered Delta 8 THC. Holy shit.,"Took a lil' cruise to the smoke shop yesterday. Anxiously walking around, trying to figure something out to buy -- entirely out of boredom from being home too long -- and then dude behind the counter says something like, ""we got weed in the shop now.""

Of course this prompted an immediate ""dafuq?"" from me. He shows me a little pamphlet. In the title was a mysterious compound I'd never heard of called ""Delta 8 THC"".

I figured this must be a derivative of regular old weed... but he claimed it got you high. Incredulously, I began to research on my phone very quickly to see if this was true. I was expecting to be disappointed, as I simply figured, no way...

Lo and behold, this shit does indeed get you high. Of course, I bought some, as I was planning on heading to the dispensary afterwards anyway (Cali representtt lol).

I hit this shit when I got home that night... and guys. I know I've been lighthearted in this post mostly recently, but I've been seriously in a hole over the past couple months, and for that matter, since I was in middle school. I've struggled with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and ADHD since I was young, and holy shit. After hitting Delta 8, it was like this MASSIVE FOG and veil was lifted off of me. I don't remember the last time I felt so clearheaded. It was as if my mind was on this dark hamster wheel, a feedback loop of intense suffering turning into more and more torture, and last night... I briefly stepped off it. I cried. I don't remember the last time I felt so normal and comfortable in my own body and mind.

It was like regular weed without the paranoia that I usually get. Like it stimulated my brain in the right areas. You're DEFINITELY high, and DEFINITELY euphoric, and get all of the added creativity and whatnot.. but NO FUCKING PARANOIA WHAT THE FUCK?! LMAO

It wasn't fully where I'd like to be, as of course it couldn't completely CURE something so deep set as what I'm dealing with.. but there was a sense of actual clarity that I haven't felt in years. Like it reverted me back a few years, where my mental illness was just starting to get a hold and weigh me down, but hadn't completely drowned me yet. But I will definitely fucking take what I can get.

Nothing's been able to do that for me, and I've been searching desperately. Herbs, supplements, you name it.

I believe that, with my bipolar medication that I am going to start, and Delta8THC, I am going to heal.

74,l289uj,LotusVibes1494,Just tried Delta-8 THC,"Ordered one full spectrum cart, one cart with just Delta-8, and a bottle of tincture to experiment with this novel cannabinoid. I'm a daily user of cannabis, mostly dabs but occasionally flower and carts, for around 10 years. 

Order arrived 30 minutes ago. I excitedly opened the package. Tried the carts first bc I want to immediately see what the effects are. 

I'm used to vaping live-resin carts from the dispensary that are fucking delicious. These D8 carts are different - more akin to the random carts I've seen people using on the street. One with clear liquid, one with bright yellow/orange liquid. Both taste weird af. Kinda like terps, but like piney chemically terps with fruit flavor. I probably won't buy these again simply bc it doesn't taste natural and that turns me off. Not to mention the whole market seems like it's in a sketchy stage, idk how safe this stuff is. I feel more comfortable getting legit carts from a dispensary nearby. 

The high is very similar regular cannabis. Surprisingly good high after taking 2 smallish hits of the full spectrum cart, it kicked kicked in slowly over about 15 minutes and not as fast as a regular THC cart. I had a small wave of anxiety but I wasn't sure what to expect and had thoughts like ""I hope this isn't destroying my lungs"" lol so that contributed to the anxiety.

Overall, the high is fine now. So similar to delta-9 that I wouldn't really notice the difference if I didn't know I was on delta-8. Maybe a bit more of the ""headband effect"" and less body high. I do like that if I run out of regular weed, I'll have these carts handy as backup. Can't think of any reason why I'd choose delta 8 OVER delta 9. I'm not personally noticing anything like ""this is better for anxiety"" or ""better for xyz"" I'm just stoned lol.

<p>Order arrived 30 minutes ago. I excitedly opened the package. Tried the carts first bc I want to immediately see what the effects are. </p>

<p>I&#39;m used to vaping live-resin carts from the dispensary that are fucking delicious. These D8 carts are different - more akin to the random carts I&#39;ve seen people using on the street. One with clear liquid, one with bright yellow/orange liquid. Both taste weird af. Kinda like terps, but like piney chemically terps with fruit flavor. I probably won&#39;t buy these again simply bc it doesn&#39;t taste natural and that turns me off. Not to mention the whole market seems like it&#39;s in a sketchy stage, idk how safe this stuff is. I feel more comfortable getting legit carts from a dispensary nearby. </p>

<p>The high is very similar regular cannabis. Surprisingly good high after taking 2 smallish hits of the full spectrum cart, it kicked kicked in slowly over about 15 minutes and not as fast as a regular THC cart. I had a small wave of anxiety but I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect and had thoughts like &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t destroying my lungs&quot; lol so that contributed to the anxiety.</p>

<p>Overall, the high is fine now. So similar to delta-9 that I wouldn&#39;t really notice the difference if I didn&#39;t know I was on delta-8. Maybe a bit more of the &quot;headband effect&quot; and less body high. I do like that if I run out of regular weed, I&#39;ll have these carts handy as backup. Can&#39;t think of any reason why I&#39;d choose delta 8 OVER delta 9. I&#39;m not personally noticing anything like &quot;this is better for anxiety&quot; or &quot;better for xyz&quot; I&#39;m just stoned lol. </p>

<p>Anyways that&#39;s my experience so far. May update when I try the tincture.</p>

75,n5kgdf,atleast1ofmywatches,Try Delta 8 Cartridges. I’ll explain,"Recently have been seeing a lot of anti-weed posts on the sub. While there is no concrete stance for a lot of people, I can definitely say as a college student that sometimes weed isn’t the best for me. I go on lazy binges and it’s all about self-control, but not everyone has that.

Delta 8 can be legally bought in most areas and it has some ups, similar to weed, with less drawbacks. Bought a Delta-8 cart a week ago and cut my weed usage back because of it. A lot less brain fog, still feel slightly lifted and energized, with some of the same appetite increase. Delta8 has me able to manage my convenience store clerk job a lot better without having to blaze before i go into work and getting paranoia or even anxiety.

That is not to say weed does not have a time and a place, but personally, I see Delta8 as an aid to me quitting and smoking a lot less.

77,lu295q,WonderfulShelter,The Bullshit of Laws Contradicting Each Other: Federally Legal Delta 8 and CBD Will Cause a Failed Drug Test,"This is more of a rant than anything else; but it frustrates me so much that Delta 8 THC is federally legal right now.  But you will still be considered a fail on a drug test if you take it.  Same as CBD, enough will cause you to fail that drug test.  Now states and employers in places where weed is legal recreationally, and medicinally, can deny you a job based on a failed drug test because they are getting federal funding which means they have to adhere to federal laws (weed is illegal federally).  But the things that are federally legal to take, will still cause a failed test - and they can then deny you employment.

Yet Marinol, the synthetic version of THC, which is federally legal, will cause a failed test as well.  BUT - if you have a prescription for it, you can legally have THC in your system and the drug test won't be considered failed, but passed, if you have THC in your system and a prescription for Marinol.

This is just an example of the laws lagging behind other laws, as well as exposes the massive hypocrisy and power that pharmaceutical corporations have in our country.  Because a medical marijuana rec. doesn't mean squat for a company when it comes to testing.

Sometimes I consider getting a marinol prescription.  It's about 700$ for the visit and prescription, and then you can legally have THC in your system.

79,khlli3,3a220l12,"delta 8 edibles - awful reaction, anyone else?","Curious if anyone has tried the new ""legal thc"" delta 8 edibles. I was told it was supposed to be a milder, shorter-acting, less-anxiety inducing high than ""normal thc"" by a friend who had tried carts of it. I'm not sure the mg amount I took but it was 2 gummies. I've had lots of experience with thc and edibles and typically do not have problems with anxiety.  the only experience that comes close  to this was a panic attack I had YEARS ago after drinking an entire energy drink and then immediately smoking. (I had not had any caffeine beforehand this time as i've learned this isn't a good combo for me).

Anyway, took the edibles and they hit FAST. Like 20 minutes fast. normally edibles don't hit me for hours. I started feeling super cooked but minus the positive moodlift I normally get from thc. I wasn't relaxed or happy I just felt weird and uncomfortable. My friends who had taken the same amount didn't feel much at that point. I tried to just sink into it and enjoy myself but everything was causing me anxiety. I tried to make food thinking that would help but I couldn't even stay standing up in the kitchen. I started to feel super dissociated (which is not a common side effect of thc for me). I tried to lay down but I started shivering/shaking intensely to the point I could barely move. I went upstairs where it was warmer thinking the cold could be responsible for the shivering but the shaking just got worse to the point that I thought I might start seizing. At this point I was definitely having a panic attack but even as I was able to get warm and get control of my breathing I couldn't stop the shaking. I was literally vibrating and flailing and my legs were painfully tensing/cramping up every time I started to shake (which was pretty much constant with maybe a 20 second break every 5 minutes or so).  After being unable to stop the shaking and debating on going to the hospital I ended up taking a small amount of xanax and was able to sleep soon after.

the next day my friends said by the time I was in the worst of it they also felt pretty dissociated/uncomfortable but didn't have near the same reaction i did. This was my first time ingesting a delta 8 product and I know this kind of panic reaction can occur with regular THC as well but I'm wondering if anyone else has had distinctly bad reactions to delta 8? at this point I think I may just be abnormally sensitive to it (it binds to a different cannabinoid receptor if I'm correct?).

89,modn1r,356959,"Really funny Delta 8 story, with no tolerence.","So I have 0 tolerance to everything except kratom and dissos which have a semi permanent tolerance, havent smoked weed in 4 months. 

I go to the store and I buy a $10 delta 8 joint, about the size of a raw king size. 

I smoke it while holding the tube I bought it in and a walk to the store that sells kratom, I had to wait an hour to buy some so I was fiendish and gave in when I bought the D8 from another store.

These really hot girls approach me and my inner monologue said “oh my god they are hot, just act natural dude “ keep in mind I’m just standing infront of the store waiting, so I felt awkward that I wasn’t doing anything and so I opened up my phone and pretended to text someone, now they are looking at me and I’m so high that I just look away and thought “omg they think I’m high” “I look so high right now”

I can’t lie it felt amazing and luckily I didn’t get drug tested for 3 days after so when I took my drug test I passed it, keep in mind I don’t eat any fat except for olive oil and whatever fat is in chicken so I was able to somewhat enjoy the delta 8 and pass my test. 

I will say though although I felt really good I can function multiple times better off of cannabis and I’m so much less awkward that I don’t think I can really smoke socially again. Maybe I’m saying this because I’m in denial that I’m not allowed to even get High, but if you guys were there with me and felt what I felt you would be laughing so hard about how I got nervous over nothing lol.

92,kj6uem,Mango2439,Delta-8-THC is so much better than Delta-9-THC,"Recently, in a couple vape stores in my town, I have seen delta-8-thc products start to pop up. Yesterday I decided to splurge on myself and buy one.

Now. I'm a pretty fucking frequent weed smoker. And I loved weed, but damn delta8 is good. 

Sometimes cannabis gives me a slight paranoid or anxious headspace, it is very helpful for a lot of other things (eating, sleeping, relaxing) but hurtful in how it effects my anxiety.

Oddly enough, delts8 doesn't give me any anxiety, while still having every other effect that normal delta9 provides.

I can definitely tell a difference in the two 2 from one another effect wise, however I am comparing a delta8 cart to full spectrum (?) Flower right now. The weed I'm smoking right now does feel distinctly different from the pure delta-8-thc.

Even compared to a normal delta9 cart, the effect are still superior to me.

I do believe however the effects are kind of close enough for most people that they can just barley tell the two apart from each other. 

My girlfriend tried the cart yesterday as well, and said that if I didnt tell her it was a Delta8 cart, then she wouldn't have suspected it to be anything but a normal cart.

Everything just gets extremely soft in a way,    you become way more empathetic and all your worries just kinda wash away.

99,mf6vin,obviously_99,How exactly is delta-8 legal?,"I may not be on the most accurate sub but I've been introduced to it about 2 months ago and it might have been longer since it was legalized in Texas, not sure. 

The effects of it are very similar to actual delta 9 in terms of intoxication. The carts are the most popular and from smoking them one of the key differences imo that seperated it from weed is that it doesn't give that dreamy feeling that only a joint or a delta 9 edible provides but more rather a mellowy sedated feel. 

I've tried the infused edibles as well and they are very much the same actually as weed edibles since Ive heard they convert to hydroxy 11 in the liver as well. 

My question is with this level of impairment that would still make it unsuitable to drive on, why is it that legality wise, they are seperated from weed. It's purely recreational, atleast for me whereas CBD is non intoxicating used mostly as medicine. You don't need any prescription to buy, just need to be 21.

103,c4xule,HIGHKIDS,Delta 8/9 THC from CBD?,"Did some research into cbd isomerization today after some old heads told me about it being done in the 70's. They claim it was a super potent dark oil that was much more psychedelic then flower or oil and it was called ""liquid thc"".

1g of 99.9% crystal cbd was disolved in 150ml of mineral spirits. A decent sized drop of HCL was then added to the mix. A wide mouth canning jar was used for this experiment. The jar was placed on an electric skillet at 175F for about 2 hours with gentle mixing every 20 minutes.

Dissociatives

3-ho-pcp- 10/10
Super immersive drug. Great for playing video games or watching movies/tv. Kinda bland for music enhancement imo, but nothing is as good for playing games. Very euphoric for me, and I didn’t think I’d want the hypomania but I fucking love it. 

Dxm- 7.7/10
The OG disso for high schoolers just wanting to get high, but also one of the best substances I have found for music enhancement. It has some nice euphoria sometimes, one of the more visual dissos I’ve taken as well. It feels like a mix of shrooms, ketamine, mdma, coke, and oxy. Truly a crazy drug, overhated bc it’s “just cough medicine”. I find I need weed to truly enjoy this one, but dxm is still a nice drug. Honestly the only reason it isn’t rated higher is because the comeup is hell and the nausea takes away from the experience a lot of the time. Used to be one of my favorites, will always be a special one for me and still one of the top three drugs for music enhancement imo. The novelty of dxm is important as well, it feels like so many different things and feels like a different drug every time I take it. Not my favorite disso, but definitely a special one. 

Mxipr- 9/10
Feels like a cleaner dxm, with more of the disso headspace/confusion, and less of the “I feel like I’ve taken every drug that exists at once” feelings. In combination with weed is has one of the most euphoric body highs I have ever experienced. Pretty decent music enhancement as well, and not really any of the negative effects of some other dissos (nausea). More on the confusing side but I still like it a lot and plan to research it more 

Ketamine - 8/10
Very interesting compound. Only tried it once, so kinda hard to rank, but I loved it. Very clean dissociation, seemed to be the strongest for out of body experiences for me, so I guess this would make it the strongest on the actual dissociation for me. Nice subtle visuals as well. Would like to try it more but it’s quite hard to get 

Dmxe- 6/10?
I put the ? Here bc I’ve only tried this one once, and it wasn’t a high enough dose. I enjoyed the experience but it was pretty mild, just some nice dissociation and music enhancement. I’ll have to try again at higher doses and update. 


Psychedelics

LSD- 9/10
The classic, the OG, the king. What do I even have to say? Lasts long enough, euphoric, music sounds amazing, beautiful visuals, nice stimulation. Acid is magical. Boosts my confidence like nothing else (yes, including coke, amphetamines, and molly). Feels so pure and I just feel so myself. Great substance. Very few negatives, besides some nausea sometimes and being unable to eat during the experience. I wouldn’t be who I am today without acid. Absolutely love it, and I feel it makes me a better person. 

Shrooms- 6.5/10
More inconsistent than acid, more mindfuck which arguably makes it more trippy, but also less pleasant most of the time. Doesn’t give me the confidence boost of acid, and the body load can be pretty uncomfortable. I admittedly haven’t done them in a while, but I rank them below acid because they’re a bit less euphoric and more uncomfortable. Still fun and sometimes are more visual than acid. It’s price is a bit of a downside, and the nausea is even more of a downside, but it’s still a worthwhile psych. 

4-ho-met- 7.8/10
The most visual psych I’ve tried so far. Very minimal headspace at lower doses, but it’s definitely possible to go “deeper” if you’re in the right environment and headspace. The vasoconstriction can be very uncomfortable, and even with supplements (magnesium and l arginine), I can’t move much during the peak of higher doses. The body high can be very uncomfortable, painful, and just tiring. The vasoconstriction can also lead to a headache on the comedown which can be very unpleasant. Still, it’s a magical substance. I’ve found that it can mimic other drugs very well. It has some empathogenic qualities, has the awe of lsd, and the mindfuck of shrooms (at times). The visuals are unlike anything I’ve tried, although they are less responsive to music and I like the open eyed visuals more. Great psych, especially for beginners. Highly recommend. Also can be easier to mix with weed than most psychs. I usually don’t smoke on psychs but with this one I can handle it if I take it slow. 

2c-b- 7.1/10
2cb is a weird one for me. For some reason I never got much visually with this one, even at higher doses. The worst thing I have ever snorted, can’t recommend that at all. Definitely prefer daytripping for this one, as I find it brings out the euphoria more. More of just a straight pleasure thing during the day, feels different than a classic trip. Still a nice one. Also is fun to mix with weed, and causes more auditory hallucinations than other psychs. I usually don’t add weed while tripping but I actually quite enjoy it when it comes to 2cb. Completely changes the experience and it can be pretty intense. I’ve heard it’s really great for sex but I haven’t tried yet. 

MDMA- 9.3/10
Next level euphoria. Nothing touches it, just pure bliss and love as the drug fucks your brain. It is a pretty forced feeling, which can be a negative for some but I don’t mind it. Not really like other psychedelics and isn’t really trippy for me, but it makes me feel amazing. Definitely worth trying this in combination with lsd too, this was the most euphoric experience I’ve ever had. Great for listening to music and laying down, even tho it is an amphetamine and is stimulating. I can get some nausea and anxiety on the comeup, but besides that not many negatives. It is a bit short for my liking, and the peak always leaves me wanting more. I personally don’t get those terrible comedowns it’s known for but I space out my doses a lot. 

DOC- 3.5/10
Not worth it IMO. The euphoria is okay, the headspace is nice, but the body load and the nausea are something else. Every muscle in my body just straight up hurt and was tense the whole damn time and when it kicked in I was throwing up for hours. Never vomited that much from anything, not even dxm. This uncomfortable onset made me not even want to trip, and I almost took a trip killer. It mixed better with weed than other psychs but still wasn’t super worth it. Also lasted so long and I hate not sleeping for that long. Idk if I’ll ever do this one again tbh. I had high expectations but there were no real redeeming factors. Visuals were mild, headspace was nice and euphoria was nice but I wasn’t having a great time most of the trip bc of the body load or throwing up. 


Stimulants 

Cocaine- 3.3/10
Cocaine is overrated. It’s always cut with some shit and it lasts like 20 minutes and then you just want more coke. I’ll admit the euphoria is pretty clean but it doesn’t last long enough for it to be worthwhile imo. It’s also expensive as hell. If I got offered some for free I might do a line but there’s no reason for me to buy some. 

Adderall- 6/10
Adderall is alright. Used to really love it but after being prescribed it for a long time the permatolerance caught up and it doesn’t hit the same anymore. I don’t love it recreationally but it can be alright, moreso I like the lower doses to actually get shit done. It was amazing before I got tolerance tho. The worst part is the crash, that shit is fucking awful. 

Vyvanse- 6.7/10
Vyvanse is the opposite of adderall for me. Really shit for getting things done but when I take a lot I get a nice confidence boost and just feel “elevated” all the time. Music sounds nice and I get tweaky fast asf. More euphoric less functionality than adderal in my experience, and the crash isn’t usually as bad as adderall which is nice. 

Concerta/Ritalin (methylphenidate)- 2/10
I have yet to try really high doses of this, but I hated being prescribed it. I found it just made me depressed and out of it and didn’t really help me get stuff done. I felt very out of it and kinda dissociated, like I had dpdr or something. It was very strong with this feeling in comparison to other stims and it lasted multiple days. Smoking weed on the comedown is kinda fun, as it is for other stims, and makes it a bit trippier. I might try higher doses to actually get high on it but I didn’t have fun trying it before.

Caffeine- 2.5/10- pretty shit drug. Doesn’t do much for me at all, makes me less focused and just makes my tics worse and increases anxiety. Also a very strong vasoconstrictor which leads to a pretty unpleasant body feeling for me. Only time it’s useful is if I pulled an all nighter doing other drugs and can’t sleep, or if I need to sober up from weed. 


Opiates

Hydrocodone- 4.4/10
Hydrocodone never really gave me any crazy euphoria, tried it in syrup and pills multiple times. It’s relaxed me and gotten me really high, but never really euphoric like oxycodone. It didn’t really have many negatives tho, besides an inability to function. Kinda boring for me tho. 

Oxycodone- 7.5/10
Probably my favorite opiate, not that I’ve tried very many. Gave me really nice euphoria, and took away all my anxiety. I remember taking and thinking if someone came in my house and took all my shit I wouldn’t even care rn. I don’t like it as much as I used to tho, and I honestly would much rather do psychs or dissos most of the time. Still, the euphoria is great and I can’t ignore that.

Kratom- 6/10
Pretty mild drug, but still fun for me. Makes music sound a whole lot better, and I find myself appreciating every song more and liking it enough to save it, then listening the next day I think it’s mid. Really fun drug to just chill out on, doesn’t give strong euphoria or anything crazy, just a strong mood lift and increased enjoyment of things. Physical sensation is really nice on this, especially cuddling/hugging.


Benzodiazepines

Xanax- 1/10
Hated this shit. Made me just retarded and out of it. I might be a little biased because I did only take it a few times, but I blacked out and didn’t enjoy it at all. It was kinda fun in the moment, but I only remember like 30 minutes out of the whole day, and at the end I got really depressed. Not one that I’d like to do again

Klonopin- 2/10
Didn’t really feel anything when I did this. Maybe I didn’t take enough, but my friends were fucked up on the same dose. Mostly just felt a really really mild relaxation. Not euphoric or anything worthwhile. I feel a greater change after I meditate tbh. 


Cannabinoids

Delta-9 thc- 6.3/10
Most people are gonna disagree with this one. I’m pretty sensitive to weed, and I get very intense and uncomfortable body highs on it. I find it usually creates anxiety and paranoia moreso than any psych or disso I’ve tried, and moreso than stims. It’s definitely fun sometimes, and the music enhancement is something I can’t ignore, but it’s not my favorite. I do get visuals most times I smoke and I like them a lot, and I really enjoy weed when it’s mixed with other substances, especially dissociatives. 

Delta-8 thc- 6.2/10
I like this a lot better than regular weed. I get much less paranoid and can control how high I get much easier. I also find it much more stimulating; one of the things I don’t like about delta 9 is how tired it makes me. Delta 8 doesn’t give me the same euphoria or music enhancement though, so in many ways it’s inferior to delta 9.

Hydroxy-11 thc- 7/10
If you’re unfamiliar, this is the compound created when thc is processed by the liver (edibles). I like edibles a lot better than smoking, I find that it’s much trippier and has less of the weird body high I get. The time dilation can be pretty intense and the mental aspect resembles psychedelics, in a weird way. Very good to mix with dxm as well. Biggest downside is the long comeup, but the peak ends up being longer as well. I do find I get less visually from edibles tho, and sometimes I get more tired, but I get the same music enhancement I do off regular weed. 


Other

Dph- 0.2/10
Almost nothing good about this drug. In low doses it was somewhat interesting because of the dreamy sedation, but once I got into actual high territory it’s just hell. Really strong panic, uncomfortable body high, weird hallucinations, confusion. Music sounds worse tbh, I guess it’s alright with the “fap dose” but even that is pretty shit because it makes your dick barely work and it’s impossible for actual sex. Shit drug, glad I’m done with it. I did it a lot before I tried weed, from doses up to 600mg, so I’d say I’m fairly experienced. Also doing it at a young age is terrible and I had some kinda hppd type shit from it because I first tried it when I was like 14 

Kava- 8.5/10
Kava is a fairly mild drug but still one of my favorites. If I drink enough I can get some decent euphoria and even get the permagrin like I do on acid. I really enjoy the sober headspace and I find it beats alcohol in terms of sociability. I can talk nonstop after I’ve had a few bowls. Great relaxation and can be stimulating at times as well.

Alcohol- 2.6/10
I really don’t like to drink much. It can be fun if you’re with a bunch of people but it just makes me really goofy and stupid. Also throwing up on it is awful, way worse than dxm, which is saying something. Throwing up drunk for me means hours over the toilet, barely having enough energy to keep my head up, while on other drugs it’s maybe 5 minutes and then you’re mostly good. Beyond that, I usually get tired before I get euphoric and I don’t like my inhibitions being that low.",1636403259.0,,I :love: Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/qpmdq0/all_27_drugs_ive_tried_ranked_out_of_10_2021/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_3u5v8k57,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'I '}, {'a': ':love:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/g4dzwm8dnvm11_t5_2qh7l/love'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Drugs'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_qpmdq0,False,dark,0.94,,public,124,4,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,124,,False,False,self,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Drugs ranked updated </p>

I really don’t like to drink much. It can be fun if you’re with a bunch of people but it just makes me really goofy and stupid. Also throwing up on it is awful, way worse than dxm, which is saying something. Throwing up drunk for me means hours over the toilet, barely having enough energy to keep my head up, while on other drugs it’s maybe 5 minutes and then you’re mostly good. Beyond that, I usually get tired before I get euphoric and I don’t like my inhibitions being that low.</p>

When I get home I unboxed it and hit it, I vant see inside whivh made me uncomfortable the only products Ive had like that were nicotine. The taste was very good it didnt taste like THC-O or Delta 8 at all but more like a disposable vape. I got pretty high but it only lasted like 20-30 minutes which is very unusual. I then realized that the brand on the disposable was a stivker going all the way around kind of like a soda bottle. I peeled it off and saw the brand ""Snic"" under it, it said it was Delta 8 and that it was 4 grams rather than 2. I was very concerned about what I had just put in my body at this point, not because it was Delta 8 but because if they lies about it being THC-O they could sure asf lie about it being delta 8. I decided to take it apart to see what was inside. I discovered a soaked piece of cotton like you would find in a nicotine disposable. What should I do about this?

When I went to sleep, I started hearing voices, all different kinds of people I don’t even recognize talk to me. It was only when I opened my eyes that they would stop, and it was incredibly hard to get myself to open my eyes. I also experienced light sensations, like my eyes were closed and then all a sudden a small circle of light got closer and closer and blinded me.

Then, after I finally fell asleep for a few hours I woke up and had to pee. I was walking to the toilet and I felt like I was walking through fog or shadows. I sat on the toilet and looked in my room and I saw a black shadow of a man standing by my bed…. He was frantically moving around and even came closer approaching the doorway of the bathroom. (and no he wasn’t wearing a hat)

I’m just wondering if this is something I should tell my psychiatrist considering I’ve heard other people have hallucinations but only when they smoke weed. I don’t really think I need to worry about it because she already told me to get off the medication after I told her how anxious, depressed, numb, nauseous, etc. it made me feel.

I am also taking zoloft which works amazing for my anxiety but does nothing for my depression, that’s why we added wellbutrin.

Now that that didn’t work I just feel completley lost. Unsure of my diagnosis: depression/anxiety, bipolar 2 (that was wrong the latuda made me nuts), and now possibly BPD.

I was prescribed clonazepam for anxiety and panic but turned to self harm when I couldn't get prescribed any more. Thc wasn't enough, I needed those pills! 

I've pretty much always smoked or vaped my thc, I've been doing it for 13 years. I hit my vape pen often and I go through .3g of oil a day to keep away any anxiety or panic symptoms... Being stoned keeps my mind busy and stops me from over thinking and slows down my thoughts and allows me to think more clearly.. ""is this situation worth reacting to in this way?

1. Based off of everything I said above, do you think I'd be better off smoking flower, vaping oil, or taking edibles (Never done edibles) to treat anxiety? Which will produce stronger effects that last longer? 

2. Would delta 8 thc be a better option? Does anyone have any thoughts on that?

125,r7vl0o,gecot63542,"Could I use THC-O, THC-P, and HHC to impress my stoner friends who've never heard of anything but regular old THC?","You know how the 2018 Farm Bill has a loophole that allows for any cannabinoid that isn't Delta-9-THC to be legally sold and used in the US, and that's how we discover alternative forms of THC that occur in the cannabis plant, such as Delta-8-THC (probably the most popular one right now).

D8 is known to be weak sauce compared to D9, so I doubt I'll be impressing my friends with that. However, I've been reading up on other THC derivatives, including: 

* HHC (said to have more indica like effects and be only about 3/4 the strength of D9)
* THC-O (said to be 3x stronger than D9 and have more sativa like effects, as well as some psychedelic properties)
* THC-P (said to be about 5-10x stronger than D9).

I have researched into different companies and brands, and I found one called Utoya Organics, based in Florida. These guys sell CBD buds that have been treated (sprayed) with a variety of different legal cannabinoids on them, including D8, HHC, and THC-O.

I'm currently looking at one blend that consists of THC-O and about 16% D8, for $20.99 per 1/8oz, as well as another blend consisting of about 65% THC-O, 10% D8, and 5% HHC, for $28.99 per 1/8oz.

So hypothetically, if I were to order this stuff and roll a j of it to pass around with my friends, could I impress them enough for them to think I've got the best killahs in town?

I had never tried edibles before due to not trusting street dealers, although due to the federal hemp bill, Delta-9-THC gummies are now legal as long as the THC concentration doesn't go over 0.3% (which means for a gummy to have 10mg of THC, it has to weigh at least 3.33 grams).

So I ordered a pack of 10 gummies, each with 10mg of Delta-9-THC, for $15 from a company called Delta Extrax, and proceeded to try some for the first time. I read up on edible dosing on Google, but most of the sites were saying stuff like that 10mg was a standard dose, 30mg is strong, and 50mg is for masochists, so I never ate more than 3 gummies at a time.

Well, no matter how much gummies I ate, I didn't really get high. I got the giggles for a bit, but that's it. At first I thought this was a worthless purchase, but then I wondered ""if what's considered strong for edibles isn't doing it for me, I wonder how many mg I'm actually getting when I smoke"".

So did some research and made some calculations. I get my weed from street dealers, so I don't have any lab results or things like that, but we do know that the average THC concentration in today's weed is around 15-30%, and if a gram is 1,000mg, that means each gram of weed I smoke contains approximately 150-300mg of THC, a far cry from what I got from that entire pack of gummies.

So in order to take it as high as I would want to by eating edibles, I would have to order two or three packs of these gummies, and then eat them all in one go, right? Doing that would cost me about $30-45, when I could just go to my plug and get a gram of bud for like $5.",1640999539.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/rt818c/i_tried_edibles_for_the_first_time_and_hardly/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_bt1tajmy,False,,0,False,[],r/Drugs,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_rt818c,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,3,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,text,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Okay, so I&#39;m a pretty heavy weed smoker: I need to smoke at least a gram of bud in one sitting to get as high as I wanna get.</p>

<p>Edit 2: because this is so much stronger there is not alot of it in the cartridge so dont expect to get a gram of pure thcp, mine has 50mg but it is still very potent and is mixed with a natural carrier oil and terpenes</p>

131,r3zd1j,ludvikkarl,Potassium Bromide trip report the first sedatives used in the 1800's way before barbiturates.,"I'm going to start off by giving you some background about me and my drug experiences. I have been exploring psychoactive substances for around two and a half years now. I have explored around 125 different substances in all different classes of drugs, anxiolytics, analgesics, antispasmodics, anticholinergics, stimulants, and of course my favorite group NMDA receptor Antagonists.(THC Delta 8 MDMA MD 1p-lsd LSD LSA DMT 5-meo-MiPT psilocybi DXM Diethyl ether  Ketamine  Memantine  Nitrous oxide  Salvia MXiPr Dck  O-pce Methoxphenidine 3-Meo-pcp Amantadine Mirtazapine DPH Dramamine Doxylamine  Myristicin Cyclobenzaprine Tizanidine chlorpheniramine Promethazine Amyl nitrate Amphetamine Dextroamphetamine Methamphetamine  Pseudoephedrine Propylhexedrine 2-fma 2-fea 3-fea 3-fm 4-fma 3-mmc 3-cmc 4-cmc Alpha-php Methylphenidate Isopropylphenidate 4f-mph Modafinil Adrafinil Armodafinil Fladrafinil Modafinil Adrafinil  Armodafinil Fladrafinil Nicotine Yohimbine n-acetylcysteine *Bromotane* prolintane Cyclazdone n methyl cyclazodone Alpha-gpc  Alprazolam Diazepam Clonazepam  Lorazepam Midazolam Clonazolam Flubromazolam Dicazloam Flunitrazolam Flualprazolam pryrazloam Etizolam Fluclotizolam Zolpidem Eszopiclone Hydrocodone  Oxycodone Codeine  Darvocet Tramadol Fentanyl Hydromorphone Meperidine Loperamide Kratom  tianeptine Naloxone  Ethanol GHB F-phenibut  Pregabalin Gabapentin Phenibut  Baclofen Picamilon  Bubitual Propofol  Methocarbamol Clonidine Guanfacine Kava Propanol Metoprolol Potassium Bromide  Valproic acid Trazodone Quetiapine Olanzapine Latuda Aripiprazole Wellbutrin Prozac Lithium Amitriptylin Doxepin Haldol Lamictal Topamax ) Throughout my exploration of these substances, I have got addicted to stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines, nicotine, anticholinergics, and other GABAergic drugs, but as of the past few months I have currently no addictions, and have a much greatly handle on my drug use. The one thing that I get most excited about is the most obscure drugs; drugs that have been banned by the FDA, drugs that are just hard to find, or drugs people didn't even know were drugs.

That being said Bromides were some of the first sedatives, anteleptics, anxiolytics used in medical practice. Other substances such as opium, and alcohol have been used before, but bromides were the first barbiturates which were the first benzos( if that makes sense). The primary bromides used were Sodium Bromide and Potassium Bromide. These medicines would build up in your system due bromides super long half life of 12 hours( which could  be sped up with diuretics and chlorides). The problem with bromides was a condition called  bromism which can be deadly. That being said this does not occur from one dose, which I am about to consume. There are very few trip reports on Potassium Bromide and Sodium Bromide, and very little information on dosing in humans, as it is no longer used in humans. After reading as much as I could about the substance I decided to go with a dose of 3 grams.

Age: 18

Sex: male 

Weight: 160lb 

Setting: At home in my room, no plans or any responsibilities to do today, except report for you guys. 

Substances consumed beforehand: Two days ago I consumed Pyrazolam for sleep and a panic attack, and yesterday I consumed admantindine( to reduce stimulant tolerance, and help with a cold sore). This morning I also consumed 250mg of caffeine. 

I mixed 3 grams of Potassium Bromide in around 200ml of water.

15:40: I just chugged the liquid which tasted exactly like salt water, but maybe with a little sweet taste to it. I also have not eaten anything for about 2 hours before. 

15:53: Maybe this is just placebo but my thoughts are starting to slow down a little bit, my head is not rushing full of ideas like it normally does. No euphoria though, just a little calm. 

16:04: The effects have not gotten any stronger. I believe what I felt was purley placebo, my stomach feels a little weird but other than that nothing new. 

16:26: I just reached the 45 min mark, something is definitely starting to happen, my thoughts are getting slower and slower, my coordination is slightly off and I keep forgetting what I was going to do. The past while I was cleaning my room which was easy at first but it's getting more challenging. Yet oddly I have not lost any motivation. A slight anxiolytic effect has started to kick in as well, with a tad of euphoria. I'm excited to see where this is going to go. Also typing is getting a little challenging. 

16:50: tried reading a book yet after about 10 words I couldn't read anymore. The effects are coming on really strong right now, it's much different than a benzo, the closest substance I could relate to it too would be a super small dose of bubitual. My thoughts have slowed down an insane amount, and my mind is kinda empty. Im going to watch a stand up on netflix and report back soon. 

17:24: This substance is super weird, I definitely have no anxiety. I'm feeling slightly tired, but I'm feeling bored in a weird way. I'm not motivated right now to do work that doesn't require thinking, but my cognitive abilities aren't as impared as a benzo. I also have no desire to redose. I am getting quite hungry, so i'm going to go make some food. 

18:05 I finished eating a pretty big meal, my appetite definitely increased. The effects of this substance are noticeable, but it's nothing great. Really just functional for anxiety right now, but my thinking is now super impared. I will report back in two hours unless something changes. 

18:12:I spoke too soon. I'm getting super tired, I am going to close my eyes for 30 mins and set my alarm to wake up. This is 2 hours and 30 mins in.

18:21 I can't even begin to describe these dreams I had they felt like real life my sister just pulled on my hand and it felt like she was trying to wake me up, but no one was there obviously                 

19:21: I had some strange dreams but its as if I knew I was sleeping or in some half state of sleep, but not super lucid, almost as if I was awake during anesthesia, but couldn't move. Im super hungry now and 'm going to eat some food and might fall back to sleep. 

19:25:  Wow food tastes amazingly better than it does on weed, zolpidem, and antipsychotics yet once I ate a little bit I became full, unlike you would on weed. I'm going to try to sleep now, I will set an alarm for 7:00. We will see how long this sedates me for. 

23:14: just woke up feeling still a little sedating and calm. This substance is obscure and definitely interesting to try but I would call it functional at all. I also drank a bunch of salt water to start flushing the bromide ions out of my system. Glad I got to try it, my next obscure drug that I would like to try would be either chloroform, 2m2b, chlorohydrate, or phenobarbital. I recently tried Pagoclone but was not quite impressed. 

Some other interesting anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives, (some easier to synthesis then others )

* Methaqualone
* Ethchlorvynol
* Paraldehyde
* Sulfonmethane
* Glutethimide
* Methyprylon 
* carisoprodol
* Lemborexant 
* Dexmedetomidine

These are obscure classes of drugs mostly banned from the FDA. There are also many different paryoltics( extreme muscle relaxers used for surgery which information about their recreational use is limited. Also other Alcohols besides ethanol and tert amyl alcohol are psychoactive, and aren't dangerous like psychoactive alcohols like methanol or isopropanol.

<p>17:24: This substance is super weird, I definitely have no anxiety. I&#39;m feeling slightly tired, but I&#39;m feeling bored in a weird way. I&#39;m not motivated right now to do work that doesn&#39;t require thinking, but my cognitive abilities aren&#39;t as impared as a benzo. I also have no desire to redose. I am getting quite hungry, so i&#39;m going to go make some food. </p>

<p>18:05 I finished eating a pretty big meal, my appetite definitely increased. The effects of this substance are noticeable, but it&#39;s nothing great. Really just functional for anxiety right now, but my thinking is now super impared. I will report back in two hours unless something changes. </p>

<p>18:12:I spoke too soon. I&#39;m getting super tired, I am going to close my eyes for 30 mins and set my alarm to wake up. This is 2 hours and 30 mins in.</p>

<p>18:21 I can&#39;t even begin to describe these dreams I had they felt like real life my sister just pulled on my hand and it felt like she was trying to wake me up, but no one was there obviously                 </p>

<p>19:21: I had some strange dreams but its as if I knew I was sleeping or in some half state of sleep, but not super lucid, almost as if I was awake during anesthesia, but couldn&#39;t move. Im super hungry now and &#39;m going to eat some food and might fall back to sleep. </p>

<p>19:25:  Wow food tastes amazingly better than it does on weed, zolpidem, and antipsychotics yet once I ate a little bit I became full, unlike you would on weed. I&#39;m going to try to sleep now, I will set an alarm for 7:00. We will see how long this sedates me for. </p>

<p>23:14: just woke up feeling still a little sedating and calm. This substance is obscure and definitely interesting to try but I would call it functional at all. I also drank a bunch of salt water to start flushing the bromide ions out of my system. Glad I got to try it, my next obscure drug that I would like to try would be either chloroform, 2m2b, chlorohydrate, or phenobarbital. I recently tried Pagoclone but was not quite impressed. </p>

<p>Some other interesting anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives, (some easier to synthesis then others )</p>

<ul>
<li>Methaqualone</li>
<li>Ethchlorvynol</li>
<li>Paraldehyde</li>
<li>Sulfonmethane</li>
<li>Glutethimide</li>
<li>Methyprylon </li>
<li>carisoprodol</li>
<li>Lemborexant </li>
<li>Dexmedetomidine</li>
</ul>

<p>These are obscure classes of drugs mostly banned from the FDA. There are also many different paryoltics( extreme muscle relaxers used for surgery which information about their recreational use is limited. Also other Alcohols besides ethanol and tert amyl alcohol are psychoactive, and aren&#39;t dangerous like psychoactive alcohols like methanol or isopropanol. I hope you guys learned something from this Cheers.</p>

134,rnukc6,bitethepsyche,"""The Cocktail of Bliss"" TRIP REPORT [TMA-2, LSD, 4-AcO-DET, THC Derivatives, Clonazepam]","In this report, I describe my intense experience with this obscure cocktail, and lightly open about my on-going dependance on benzodiazepines.

Preface:

I take Clonazepam everyday, admittedly almost every day drug user for different reasons, not prescribed. I am also not worried about this state of mind in this context. It is a crutch to deal with my own emotions but I don’t take enough daily to impair my functionality. That’s what I tell myself. I do it throughout the day, sometimes as a way to cope with stress. I do have prior experience with various phenethylamines at different dosages. One of my similar trips to note was DOC and Mushrooms. I am curious how TMA-2 will interact with 4-AcO-DET and how it will be different. I use cannabis regularly, and decided to include 50mg of Delta 10 to tonight's cocktail. I have had few recent experiences with TMA-2 prior to this. 20mg and 63mg.

Setting:

I will be alone in my room, with all my family in the house. I am not too worried about them coming into the room as it is late at night. I plan to stay in my room, and report how I react to these compounds. I’ve tripped here often, I usually listen to music, browse my laptop and play video games. Because of my attitude and mindset right now, I think this is the right environment.

Experience:

T+0:00/11:36PM: I take a gel capsule with 50mg weighed out along with 50mg Delta 10 THC. This is a product I recently picked up from a smoke shop so I can’t promise this product was of best quality. I am excited to have another journey on my own. I just came home from seeing other friends. Two had also taken TMA-2 earlier, and I am about how their trip is going, considering they are on SSRI’s. I wonder if this concern will affect my experience. Good timing...

I did not set any intention, but I hope I have an enjoyable experience nonetheless. At this point in my life, It feels like I am just testing my body for fun.

12:16AM: As I wait for the compound to begin to come up, I decide I want to add LSD to my experience. I cut a 100ug tab in half, so I am assuming I will consume 50ug of LSD-25. Already feeling warm and energetic, excited to see what is to come!

I finally got the half tab on my tongue, and I began feeling lightness in my head and body. There are some initial encouraging effects. I can’t tell if it is my previous Clonazepam dosage that is making me feel so sedated, but the floaty phenethylamine tingle is growing in my head, my body feels more and tingly. I feel a lot less motivated to play my game. I am more and more bed locked.

12:50AM I hate to say it, but I really hope this Clonazepam is not dampening my experience too much. I feel so tired, and just as I nod out I have a sharp burst of energy. Looking and feeling around me I know its setting. The benzo is making it too relaxing. Looking back, I would take back how much Clonazepam I've taken today. And throughout the month. It doesn't seem to be stopping the TMA-2 now! Music sounds great as I wait and nod off. I decided to try and do something other than lie down.

I enjoy playing Skate 3 and killing spots in the game while I come up. I took ginger root to help with the funny stomach feeling. I get the same feeling in my eyes, jaw and entire face. I feel a significant change in headspace

1:13AM I consumed 18mg 4-AcO-DET. I assume the peak of the TMA;2 is ahead of me. As of right now, there are subtle visual and color distortions, but I mainly feel a typical energetic yet still lacking psychedelic headspace. But as I type, these effects increase greatly. Just used my Delta 8 Vape device. I wonder if the Delta 10 THC is having an effect? I feel a little stoned. There is not much muscle tension. My face and my eyes are becoming very droopy. I feel mentally awake, but physically still sedated. All music is just as good to me. At this moment, I feel like this is exactly what I want to be doing. I feel content. I crave contentedness, but that craving only drives me further from it. I have the whole night and next day to enjoy this!

I want to keep my eyes closed, but everytime I open my eyes I watch my walls begin to move, colors embedded into the shadows of everything, Similar to my experience with DOC, visually.

I’ve been believing Clonazepam will fix my “problems”. And oftentimes I try to prove it to myself. And I am aware, especially at this moment. I think about all the times my friends have had to hold me accountable. Unintentionally, I am taking a look at my addiction from a new perspective, but because of the Clonazepam already in my system I don’t give myself the power to explore this headspace as much as I should have.

1:26AM: It is a LOT more visual now. I am getting waves of love and intimacy. Laying and watching closed eye visuals. Out of every psychedelic I have tried, I think this would for sure be one of the best sex drugs. Just because of how shallow but warm it is. I see geometric patterns almost emerging from thin air, or applied onto objects. Pink, Green mainly circles and squares creating a beautiful stran lost in seconds. But this is all emerging from everything around me. I'm loving it! I think about how lucky I am, and how much I love life. I don’t love it enough at the moment as much as I should. I really don't want to do anything, just enjoy music and write. I keep taking rips of my Delta 8 vape. I’m stoned, but it is heavily bringing out life from everything I see. In an almost literal sense, everything moves as it is on its own, without my influence. Lots of geometry moving onto and from objects as I look around. The body load is easy! Way better than 5-MeO-MiPT no matter the recommended dosage.

All genres sound amazing, but I am going to explore some energetic edm music. I won't even bother going as in depth as before into the geometry, because it is just exponential rapid variation of shapes radiating from everything around me. There are beautiful patterns all across my computer screen, I am in an incredible headspace. So far, the visuals are still subtle for this dosage as one would expect from TMA-2. I do have a tolerance to TMA-2 from using it about half a week ago, especially with the benzo it didn't stop TMA-2’s effects by any means.

1:52AM: I want to sleep, but I'm going to endure the temptation and get the most out of the DET. This capsule was special to me because it had been held onto for so long before my connection lost it. Every stimulant gives me a feeling of “manic” euphoria. Almost as if it's being put onto me and not coming from me. I feel a similar reminiscence of mania but mainly feel like I am enjoying the effects for its psychedelic properties, not as a stimulant at 50mg.

I can manage myself just fine. There is SO much geometry and color thriving around me as if it is alive. But I feel so tired at the same time. I want to enjoy this for what it is. I don’t know If i will fall asleep. My hands are shaky as well. I feel SO relaxed, and my heart rate is slow! That's a good sign for me. Especially when I open or move my eyes. It keeps getting stronger following everything I do.The full color spectrum, but kinda metallic. 2D very quickly became 3D living visual perceptions. I am so happy I can record this trip, because I haven't recorded many of them in my life. I have been changing my music input the whole night.

I am totally immersed into the new halo MULTIPLAYER. It is beautiful. It made me think about how silly it is that people fight in a virtual world. It made me feel kinda weird, but it's cool. The 4-AcO-DET is for sure kicking in. I watch 10 trails of my hand follow itself when I move it in front of my face. There is psychedelia emerging OUT of everything and it's all very positive. I welcome this feeling. My room looks as if it is alive, very un still. I keep hitting the Delta 8 cartridge, it increases the effect by a lot. But I realize my Delta 8 deceive could be so much better. I am wishing I had regular delta 9 from a dispensary. It is almost like my face is falling in different directions. I'm pretty disoriented.

I really start to think about my ex-girlfriend. I want to make sure I keep a healthy relationship with her, even after we spent a year apart. We are still friends to this day. The visuals are so fluid, wet, and extremely saturated. It is almost like I have 4-D Glasses on. My trip report looks so beautiful to me right now. And I'm savoring this moment. I attempt to stare at the same spot for 10 seconds and see an indescribably intricate wall of psychedelia all over my wall, and everything I see, I have immense energy to move around still. I feel like I'm in and out of lucidity. I really want to play Halo Infinite, but I no longer feel capable of using a controller properly. I'm going to lay down and take more OEV in.

2:00AM I can't believe it's only 3AM! Well, now it feels like the entire night went by just like that. All my time is gone. I just want a memory of the time I have. A really good one. That should be on Halo. It is really hard to concentrate. I feel so warm, I feel powerful, I feel sleepy, I feel everything.

3:47AM There are a lot of open eye visuals. I see all different types of visuals. They move a lot when I move my eyes or body especially.

It was really nice to use the Delta 8 cart. For me it only lasts around 20 minutes, I don't even know what I'm typing, my memory keeps failing me. I keep forgetting what I want to write. Psychedelia is everywhere, but at no point did I ever feel stressed out. This is a really special trip. TMA-2 is a great drug to mix with cannabis, over mushrooms and lsd in my opinion. I still have a semi lucid state and also a lot of things confuse me. I noticed I wasn't so bad at halo earlier. I might give it a try, but I'm meditating now instead.

4:45AM I layed on the floor and became entranced by the visuals, followed my breathing and did good self work... It looked beautiful everywhere around me. Some visuals worth mentioning reminisce of cyborg-like cheetah patterns of blue, grey and orange and everything! There are no words for me to properly convert them into this page, sadly. I feel so tired. I think I'm going to take the rest of the night to myself and report later. The 4-AcO-DET is an incredible booster to the TMA-2. I relied a lot on delta 8 throughout the night....

One final activity song I listened to was “A Little Taste of Heaven” by Leach, shown to me by my friend M. The auditory distortions the trip had on this song was astonishing and all encompassing.

It is 6:00AM and I am high only from my cart. I think the edible had an effect as well. I expect my parents to start waking up. I take 1mg of Clonazepam. I really want to savor this combo though.

The Delta 8 & 10 THC changed the attitude of my trip but actually gave me some energy later on. The headspace is so open and enjoyable but introspective at the same time.

6:30AM: I start to feel exhausted, my room looks gray and I feel the sweat in my clothes. I feel the clonazepam strip away all the magic laid before me. I feel disappointed the night is over, but I am glad I found time to explore another obscure combination of drugs.

Conclusion:

I wake up at 4:00PM the same day, even after sleeping for so long I feel off baseline, cold and gray still. During my trip, I felt absolutely no stress or anxiety. A trip like this is a treat, and I miss the beauty sprayed across my vision. I looked deep into myself and into my past, and had revelations about my presence on earth and to other people. I hope to integrate it in the weeks to come. This trip was far less introspective and eye opening than DOC/Mushrooms. I think the Delta 10 Edible and Clonazepam are largely responsible as well as general psychedelic tolerance. My friends I mentioned in the beginning who mixed TMA-2 with their prescription to Zoloft and Effexor both had a great time and did not experience unpleasant side effects to my knowledge.",1640378902.0,,Long Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/rnukc6/the_cocktail_of_bliss_trip_report_tma2_lsd/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_3os9lpk5,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Long Post'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Custom,0,,,False,t3_rnukc6,False,dark,0.72,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,3,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>In this report, I describe my intense experience with this obscure cocktail, and lightly open about my on-going dependance on benzodiazepines.</p>

I feel so tired. I think I&#39;m going to take the rest of the night to myself and report later. The 4-AcO-DET is an incredible booster to the TMA-2. I relied a lot on delta 8 throughout the night....</p>

<p>One final activity song I listened to was “A Little Taste of Heaven” by Leach, shown to me by my friend M. The auditory distortions the trip had on this song was astonishing and all encompassing.</p>

<p>It is 6:00AM and I am high only from my cart. I think the edible had an effect as well. I expect my parents to start waking up. I take 1mg of Clonazepam. I really want to savor this combo though.</p>

<p>The Delta 8 &amp; 10 THC changed the attitude of my trip but actually gave me some energy later on. The headspace is so open and enjoyable but introspective at the same time.</p>

<p>6:30AM: I start to feel exhausted, my room looks gray and I feel the sweat in my clothes. I feel the clonazepam strip away all the magic laid before me. I feel disappointed the night is over, but I am glad I found time to explore another obscure combination of drugs.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>I wake up at 4:00PM the same day, even after sleeping for so long I feel off baseline, cold and gray still. During my trip, I felt absolutely no stress or anxiety. A trip like this is a treat, and I miss the beauty sprayed across my vision. I looked deep into myself and into my past, and had revelations about my presence on earth and to other people. I hope to integrate it in the weeks to come. This trip was far less introspective and eye opening than DOC/Mushrooms. I think the Delta 10 Edible and Clonazepam are largely responsible as well as general psychedelic tolerance. My friends I mentioned in the beginning who mixed TMA-2 with their prescription to Zoloft and Effexor both had a great time and did not experience unpleasant side effects to my knowledge.</p>

137,qsiykg,StoopSign,Shout-out to my gas station manager!,"So every morning I walk to the gas station to buy my coffee, drinks and Delta 8 and Vapes if necessary. I switched from using regular edibles to D8 edibles because they were cheaper. My tolerance shot up so I'm quitting the edibles. The gas station has also started carrying THC-O and I've been playing around with that. So I've definitely dumped to much money into this gas station over the past few months and they've compd lighters and other stuff due to loyalty. Today they gave me an eighth of Delta-8 ""moonrocks"" which i suppose is the only way to make D8 herb. Must just be CBD coated in a D8 concentrate but it tastes great and has a nice mellow high, that i probably wouldn't pay for, but it's cool that the stuff retails for $30 and they gave it to me free when only getting a Coffee and Arizona. It's more often the case that they toss something in for free when i spend more. This also was in a gift bag so it seemed pre-planned as ""give this to the kid who loves the delta 8""

139,pjoy5i,TheBlankestBoi,Hit me with your nostalgic drug memories.,"When I was 18 I ordered Delta 8 gummies off of the internet (I can’t tell you from where, but it was a hemp empire from Boston) and took one of them with my girlfriend (who was visiting from college) while my family went to a football game in a city a few hours away. We took them in my kitchen while I made fried mashed potatoes (a little well beaten egg mixed with mashed potatoes and a little garlic powder, rolled as balls in bread crumbs, and than deep fried) and by the time I was done I was starting to feel a little dizzy, but my girlfriend (who had smoked weed a couple times before) wasn’t feeling anything, and had a family reunion at her parents house a couple blocks away, so we decided to pack up the potatoes and bring them to the reunion. By the time we left I was walking a little funny, but my girlfriend didn’t feel anything until we where about a block away from my house and she started to get giggly and stumbly. So we stumbled drunkenly through our neighborhood in early November and than just slid into the family reunion, just in time for my girlfriends family (who are all republicans) to learn the outcome of a certain election that made a lot of republicans very upset.

3:10 pm - tea prep. 3 small caps, 1 med-large cap, 1 cup water, lemon juice (approx. 1 tsp), and a raspberry hibiscus teabag, simmering slightly above medium heat for about 20 minutes. 

3:30 pm- strained with coffee strainer into mug. 1 tsp of honey. tasted exactly how you'd expect raspberry hibiscus mushroom tea with honey to taste, a bit like dirt. i kinda liked it &amp; drank it quickly.

4:00 pm- tested my heart rate, 100 bpm. it might have been anxiety from trying something new that i knew  could potentially become unpleasant.

4:15 pm- began to feel tipsy-heavy, fuzzy, and warm.

4:30 pm- worried i wouldnt feel more than slightly drunk &amp; decided to make more tea, using 2 medium caps, heated at a slightly lower temp.

5:00 pm- started having heartburn. smoked some delta 8 to reduce nausea. was sweating a bit. setting: reading a book on my bed

5:30 pm- up to this point the main effects were intense time distortion and a satisfying full-body high, not dissimilar to dxm. felt spacey, and my thoughts took on a physically bouncy quality. setting: laying down, watching star trek

6:00 pm- i have no idea how to describe this, but i wrote in my journal: ""my mind's eye becomes a nat geo magazine."" im always confused about what my ""mind's eye"" consists of, but under the influence of fly agaric i recall feeling as though the shape of my imagination was vaguely squarish & overlapping in layers with itself, and i visualized things with far more clarity than usual, though i didn't really seem to be able to control what i envisioned. i noted seeing random flashes of things behind my field of view and vibrant after-images.

141,pfcse7,Mduffy900,In hell on THC-O. First trip ever,"I Don't know if this is the right place to put this but I cannot find the thc-o sub because I am too high.

I recently turned 21 so I decided to start experimenting with legal thc (zero previous experience) . I tried delta 8 and it was great but I built a tolerance almost immediately so that's what brings me to this. I have never written one of these so please bear with me.

7:00pm I take one puff and wait sit down at my computer.

7:30pm Nothing is happening so I take two more puffs big ones with 15 sec holds this was a total mistake

7:45pm I am staring dead eyed at my computer screen when it starts to move in a circular path in front of me, it is level and i can still make sense of what is one the screen at this point, then my face and head start to follow the same sort of path completely on there own then it feels like someone put a taffy puller in my mouth as my mouth starts contorting in extreme ways very slowly.

7:50pm things are ramping up and I am dissociating I decide I NEED to get in my bed NOW

7:55pm There's a bathroom between my office and my bedroom I walk in and suddenly me and the bathroom are the only things that exist. I fly off into nothingness in my space ship bathroom almost exactly like the episode of spongebob, you know the one. There are two doors on either side of the bathroom and I'm freaking out because I don't remember which one I need to go through.

8:00pm-9:00pm I eventually got to bed and I get this huge urge to take another hit even though I'm not having any fun it's almost like this satanic masochistic urge. So I take another hit two actually each one bigger than the last and fall back into bed. I am defiantly way past responsible use at this point.  The taffy puller in my face is on full speed and I am completely dissociating reality its self is spinning violently and collapsing I feel like I am being torn apart or ripped away from reality itself(no fractals or colors just intense body and mind high), I'm fadding away, dying even?

9:00pm-12:00pm I spiral HARD I am definitely dying yup I start pleading with God for my life (I am an atheist or at least was lol) I am face to face with my whole life all my regrets and actions I promise god I will do better and plead for him not to take me right now and just ask for this to end. It doesn't, I start getting mad exclaiming it isn't fair in my head, I had been duped I still have more to do in this life and I wasn't going to submit. This went on till I eventually submitted and fell into a tunnel and slept.

3:30am-5:00am I wake up and I'm not tripping and I'M ALIVE. I am so happy that I'm alive but this doesn't last long and it feel like the longer I'm awake the more it returns even though I haven't smoked in a while I try to watch a youtube video on my laptop to maybe ancor myself to reality plugging in my password after a herculean effort I pull something up and it doesn't work, I am back to the tunnel and I fall asleep at 5:00am

10:30am 11:45 am Awake again with a new sense of awareness I say hi to my folks and keep it together somehow. I take a cold shower, meditate and go for a walk this whole time Its coming up again and I am fighting it with my awareness though I barely made it back from my walk. My face spasms are now worse than last night.

11:45am- 2:47pm I have been writing this with tremendous effort I am definitely still feeling the effects which I don't how that's even possible my face is still doing the thing and sometimes my vision goes fish-eye and distorts which makes it very difficult to type I feel like I am fighting demons that are trying to pull me from reality by intense bouts of mindfulness, I feel like if I let go I can go all the way to the bottom again. I desperately want this to end. I feel like I've learned my lesson.

Closing thoughts: I did research on thc-o before this, It was called the spiritual canabinoid in some places but most individual testimonies seemed to say it was just a stronger delta 8 and this was an oversell. Maybe for the every day stoner partaking in D-9. Needless to say I cannot hang.

TL;DR Very stupid with my dosing of Thc-o especially as a total newbie and have been tripping intensely for 18 hrs after my last hit.

UPDATE: It has almost been 48 hours after my last hit I still feel the dissociative/depersonalization effects come on in waves along with the face twitching but no hyperspace, I fear I have definitely given myself some sort of anxiety disorder or ptsd that's causing me to relive the trip as there is no way in hell it is still in my system. I am confident this will go away but until then I am in a lot of mental pain. This will probably be my last update because writing about it isn't helping anymore. Don't do drugs... especially if your an idiot like me.

<p>8:00pm-9:00pm I eventually got to bed and I get this huge urge to take another hit even though I&#39;m not having any fun it&#39;s almost like this satanic masochistic urge. So I take another hit two actually each one bigger than the last and fall back into bed. I am defiantly way past responsible use at this point.  The taffy puller in my face is on full speed and I am completely dissociating reality its self is spinning violently and collapsing I feel like I am being torn apart or ripped away from reality itself(no fractals or colors just intense body and mind high), I&#39;m fadding away, dying even?</p>

<p>9:00pm-12:00pm I spiral HARD I am definitely dying yup I start pleading with God for my life (I am an atheist or at least was lol) I am face to face with my whole life all my regrets and actions I promise god I will do better and plead for him not to take me right now and just ask for this to end. It doesn&#39;t, I start getting mad exclaiming it isn&#39;t fair in my head, I had been duped I still have more to do in this life and I wasn&#39;t going to submit. This went on till I eventually submitted and fell into a tunnel and slept.</p>

<p>3:30am-5:00am I wake up and I&#39;m not tripping and I&#39;M ALIVE. I am so happy that I&#39;m alive but this doesn&#39;t last long and it feel like the longer I&#39;m awake the more it returns even though I haven&#39;t smoked in a while I try to watch a youtube video on my laptop to maybe ancor myself to reality plugging in my password after a herculean effort I pull something up and it doesn&#39;t work, I am back to the tunnel and I fall asleep at 5:00am</p>

<p>10:30am 11:45 am Awake again with a new sense of awareness I say hi to my folks and keep it together somehow. I take a cold shower, meditate and go for a walk this whole time Its coming up again and I am fighting it with my awareness though I barely made it back from my walk. My face spasms are now worse than last night.</p>

<p>11:45am- 2:47pm I have been writing this with tremendous effort I am definitely still feeling the effects which I don&#39;t how that&#39;s even possible my face is still doing the thing and sometimes my vision goes fish-eye and distorts which makes it very difficult to type I feel like I am fighting demons that are trying to pull me from reality by intense bouts of mindfulness, I feel like if I let go I can go all the way to the bottom again. I desperately want this to end. I feel like I&#39;ve learned my lesson.</p>

<p>Closing thoughts: I did research on thc-o before this, It was called the spiritual canabinoid in some places but most individual testimonies seemed to say it was just a stronger delta 8 and this was an oversell. Maybe for the every day stoner partaking in D-9. Needless to say I cannot hang.</p>

<p>TL;DR Very stupid with my dosing of Thc-o especially as a total newbie and have been tripping intensely for 18 hrs after my last hit.</p>

<p>UPDATE: It has almost been 48 hours after my last hit I still feel the dissociative/depersonalization effects come on in waves along with the face twitching but no hyperspace, I fear I have definitely given myself some sort of anxiety disorder or ptsd that&#39;s causing me to relive the trip as there is no way in hell it is still in my system. I am confident this will go away but until then I am in a lot of mental pain. This will probably be my last update because writing about it isn&#39;t helping anymore. Don&#39;t do drugs... especially if your an idiot like me.  </p>

Basically, I quit self medicating cold turkey. The stuff I was doing was (mostly) legal, aside from the occasional mj smoke sesh with friends. I used Delta 8, CBD, and Kratom. The Kratom was the most difficult to kick, as the w/d were horrible. But I got through it. 

I don’t want to start the Kratom again because of the physical and mental pain it caused me, even though I LOVED taking it. It gave me energy and a mood boost. It provided exactly what I needed to get through the work day. Nowadays, the only thing I take for energy is coffee, and even that is limited due to the pregnancy. 

So when I get this baby outta me, what do you all recommend for energy/focus and mood boost that won’t f me up? I’ve heard good things about nootropics, but I have zero knowledge of them.

i went to a party the other night and as i was leaving my apartment to go, my roommate’s friend offered me an edible which by all appearances looked like a regular delta 8 candy. she said she bought it at a smoke shop and i’ve never been one to turn down a free edible, i took it and left. i got to the party and started drinking immediately, i did a shot and started drinking a pretty strong mixed drink which is completely normal for me, on any other occasion i usually don’t feel anything at that point but i remember making a comment that i was ‘really feeling it’, i was pretty tipsy. this of course didn’t hinder me and i ended up finishing my drink and getting another. this was over the span of about an hour i would say. 

a few sips into my second drink i was really starting to feel drunk and i remember feeling like i was losing control over what i was saying and doing, which is definitely not typical for me- even when i’m inebriatedly drunk i still feel generally in control. for about 10-20? minutes i was in this state of feeling super fucked up, just really loose and weightless all over. i remember dancing at one point and saying that i couldn’t feel the floor under my feet, i felt like i was floating like a ghost. then i sat down again, i should mention my friends had made me drink a cup of water during this time, and i remember saying “i need to be on the ground” and i sort of slinked to the floor and laid down.

i don’t remember much once i hit the floor but i remember this is when i realized i couldn’t move any of my body parts. i felt like i was mostly asleep and occasionally waking up every few minutes, like that out of it to where i wasn’t alarmed that i couldn’t move anything. my eyes were wide open and i couldn’t even close them. at this point my friends had dragged me like a rag doll to a bathroom and i could hear what they were saying but i couldn’t move or see, despite my eyes being wide open. i remember thinking ‘oh god they’re gonna think i’m dead’ and ‘holy shit i fucked up’. the high feeling i was experiencing did not feel like it was weed at all, it felt so bizarre like nothing i’ve ever had. i remember not being able to feel myself breathing though i knew i had to be. my memory is really spotty during this but i remember vomiting a little. basically after that i was like 75% unconscious and had to be carried home, i’m very grateful and lucky i was with good people who took care of me. i was probably completely unconscious by 11pm and i woke up at 5am feeling really weird, but mostly sober and i remember the veins in my hands were bulging out really bad.

The most under smoked plant material containing terpenes of bioavailable mass in concentrations high enough to cause intoxication. Virtually few side effects. 

Kratom can be smoked and is not commonly ingested in this manner. 

Kratom contains terpenes, terpenoids, and diterpenoids. Salvia Divinorum and Turkish sage both have the diterpenoids Salvinorin a and B. Cannabis also contains terpenes, followed by scores of herbal teas with a library of compouds of this type with some known bioavailable effect.

Kratom is not native and literature is somewhat scattered on the plant. It is known to have 45 alkaloids but the full Spectra of effects of each of these isn't fully recognised in medicinal literature.

There is still, a wealth of info available on the species of plant mitragyna speciosa and I recommend taking an interest in this seemingly nuancial gas station plant powder.

Last night I  and my wife had intense visuals, psychedelic thought, lethargy in limbs yet excitable euphoria of mind. Making it feel as if we could see the pixels in the ocean of air we felt as though we had to ""swim"" through, as opposed to merely move through.


We consumed .6grams of kratom red maeng da powder from the brand PAIN OUT between us two, I smoked the most making it a 60/40 split on that .6. 

It was first mixed thuroughly with cannabis, coating each piece of ground flower, look like it was  kief krusted with kratom.

About 4 bowls of this smoked over a 3 hour period. 

Strong chocolat cacao drink was brewed, 3 cups consumed. 
Spearmint tea with lemon grass and green tea.
Aged Earl grey by Numi.
 
This wrapped up with Delta-8, delta-10, and regular legal medicinal cannabis concentrates and a final bowl of tobacco and kratom powder. 

We experienced strong feelings, had visuals with open eye that were nuance, and strong patterning and geometry with eyes closed.

This is for educational purposes and is an honest and accurate representation of events, experiences and substances used in this recantation of experience.

We regularly ingest delta-8, delta-10, THCO A, And medicinal Delta 9 containing cannabis products. 

We have consumed kratom before in the manner of it being brewed into coffee. 
We have taken psychedelics and many other substances and consider our selves psychonauts.

<p>It was first mixed thuroughly with cannabis, coating each piece of ground flower, look like it was  kief krusted with kratom.</p>

<p>About 4 bowls of this smoked over a 3 hour period. </p>

<p>Strong chocolat cacao drink was brewed, 3 cups consumed. 
Spearmint tea with lemon grass and green tea.
Aged Earl grey by Numi.</p>

<p>This wrapped up with Delta-8, delta-10, and regular legal medicinal cannabis concentrates and a final bowl of tobacco and kratom powder. </p>

<p>We experienced strong feelings, had visuals with open eye that were nuance, and strong patterning and geometry with eyes closed.</p>

<p>I do not encourage just anyone to try to replicate or Reinact this psycho somatic symptomalogical write up as the work and substances put into the endeavour may cause harm to one&#39;s self. This is for educational purposes and is an honest and accurate representation of events, experiences and substances used in this recantation of experience.</p>

<p>We regularly ingest delta-8, delta-10, THCO A, And medicinal Delta 9 containing cannabis products. </p>

<p>We have consumed kratom before in the manner of it being brewed into coffee. 
We have taken psychedelics and many other substances and consider our selves psychonauts. </p>

<p>The kratom is our honest guess at what produced this strong experience.</p>

<p>It was a BLAST.</p>

I literally can’t even use the fridge at night because he refuses to move out the way so I can grab something. Then he ends up eating whatever he finds in the kitchen and spilling half of it on the floor, I literally found chocolate on the floor a few nights ago and we own two dogs. I wouldn’t give a shit if his drinking didn’t effect me, he emotionally abused me my whole entire childhood which lead me to having anxiety and low self esteem. 

My doctor has me on new medication and it’s made me highly aggressive. I quit taking it because it’s making me the opposite of who I truly am.  All I asked out of my dad was 2 delta 8 gummies so I can take them and smoke some regular bud. I said “can you get them now so you won’t forget” he said “I won’t forget.”  He fucking forgot so now I have to look at my own father wasted out of his fucking mind just for two fucking gummies. 

Sorry I’m heated, I’m not normally like this but he’s been like this my whole life and I’m sick of it. Literally all he does is drink beer then he has the nerve to bitch at me for smoking a gram of weed per day.

151,qk40p4,fuccTHEsucc,Out of this world hallucinations/psychosis from weed.,"I finally hands on some real weed, not that delta 8 stuff and gave it a shot.   

Well, I experienced a full on psychedelic trip that felt exactly like my 300ug acid trip, but it only lasted 40 minutes and because of its short duration I was able to remember more things and I can describe exactly how weed and acid make me feel like. I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy.   

As I was smoking, I noticed that my heart rate rate started going up more than normal. Then when I decided I've had enough to smoke, I notice my heart rate is in the 190s and I realize I'm fucked big time because I had to walk back into my car. I nearly passed out twice on the way to my car from this high of a heart rate, but eventually I made it.   

As I reached my car, my whole body started getting numb, and my chest went 100% numb. I wasn't able to feel my chest. It's as if I had a whole in my chest. At the same time I felt like someone was squishing my heart, and sometimes I would feel shortness of breath. Then I felt heat moving through my body I also felt like something was touching my body with its hands, including my internal organs. I guess they call this body high? Yuck this was awful.   

Then about after 5 minutes after smoking, I suddenly feel wide awake, but not in a great way. I felt the same as the one time I overamped on meth. Then I'm noticing that each time I change my thoughts, I feel a psychical sensation in my brain as if someone is changing the CD each time my thought pattern changes.   

Right after that the crazy out of this world shit started happening. Suddenly everything sped up. It felt as if life is a silent movie and things are slightly speed up. What I knew as reality started to slowly dissipate. I would look at myself in the mirror and then look away, but this would happen like 10 times. Even though I was not looking at the mirror, I would still see my face in the mirror turn away over and over again like a gif. I would occasionally see some flashing stars, something reminiscent of a migraine aura. I would start seeing myself in third person and everything started feeling like I was watching .GIFs of myself over and over again. I close my eyes, and I see that I have full blown closed eye visuals like one would have on a mushroom trip. Everything started looping over and over and over again, reality was bending like I was nearing a black hole and suddenly I snapped and lost control and entered the coocoo land. This is the same place I would enter each time I take a psychedelic like LSD or shroom and this is a very scary place.   

This ""coocoo land"" I am referring to is a hallucination so powerful that it's very hard to put in words how it feels. It feels like you are being pulled into a black hole and you are watching reality slowly melt. Everything just melts. Nothing feels real anymore. You are stuck in a loop. You always have been. This is your entire life. Your entire life is this loop. You panic. You realize you are fucked. Nothing make sense anymore. You lost your sanity. You feel like you're stuck in this feeling forever and that this is what it feels like to be mentally ill. Then you for a brief moment hear or see something that reminds you of what reality is, of what the definition of normal is, and you feel this relief as if you wake up from a terrible nightmare, but then suddenly you go back into this state where reality melts and your sanity is gone and you get even more scared. Basically this is comparable to having a nightmare in a nightmare in a nightmare in a nightmare, and so on.   

Things are really hard to describe when you're in this state. The world around you completely disappears. The sky disappears. The trees disappear. It's just you and whatever is within arms reach and the rest is just a void. You can look to your left and, for example, see a black car, and then you would look to your right and you would see that black car in that same location, even though you turned your head 180 degrees. Then you can start seeing yourself in third person turn the head over and over again. It's fucking loop that is very hard to escape.   

Luckily I was able escape this in about 2 minutes as opposed to 5 hours when I take LSD. I took 3 puffs of that weed again today, which is much less, and I still had this weird headspace, numbness in my chest, and seeing things in a sped up matter like in a silent movie, but I very quickly got over it. It seems like I made the first step in the right direction. I really want to get over this shit and enjoy acid because I get stuck in these awful reality-warping loops and don't see any fractals or typical lsd hallucinations.   

TL:DR smoked weed. had closed eye visuals, lost my sense of reality, I would see myself in third person, my life was split into 5-10 second time periods that I would relieve over and over again like a .GIF, had false sensations of awakening thinking that I managed to escape only to find out I am still losing my mind.",1635732225.0,,Cannabinoids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/qk40p4/out_of_this_world_hallucinationspsychosis_from/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_zj6g0,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Cannabinoids'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Cannabinoids,0,,,False,t3_qk40p4,False,light,0.89,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,7,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I finally hands on some real weed, not that delta 8 stuff and gave it a shot.   </p>

I always have this itch to not be sober. It doesn’t matter what it is, anything that offers a different reality than sober pleases the addicted part of me, the part currently controlling me. 

I smoke weed everyday. I use delta 8 which for me, is extremely intoxicating. I’m currently on 30 mg of the edibles and I couldn’t drive safely. I usually get rather high most of the day and super high at least once a day, which lasts for hours. 

I drink beer almost every day. Most days just 1-3 but I’d say like once a week I get drunk drunk. 

I smoke cigarettes.

For the past week or so I’ve been abusing DPH, taking higher and higher doses. The other night I took 175 mg with edibles and saw shadow people in the woods at night. 

I also take Phenibut quite a lot. I used to do it more but threw away my supply. Stupidly, I bought more the other day and did it the first two days I had it in high doses. 

Also, I drive fucked on weed and Phenibut sometimes and it’s not fucking right. I can’t believe I have been doing that.

155,qxkkjs,YEET-THAT-MEAT,Drug Reviews Part Two,"I was feeling bored again. So here’s some more drug reviews. Been a long time since [my last one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/lbohvg/drug_reviews/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) but I’ll be going into more depth on some of the same drugs and also touching on some new ones. If you’re confused by my formatting, there’s a little description of my system in the first post.


**Psychedelics**

Delta-8 THC (Taken Orally: 15mg, 25-50mg, 60+) - This one is whack. It’s like the sativa thc molecule. No discernible body-load at a lower dose. The headspace is like a slightly energized version of regular old Delta-9 THC. The first time I used this one I didn’t think it was working until I was in a drive-thru and when I got asked what I wanted to order I realized how high I was, got distracted, and just screamed “I don’t know! I’m sorry!”, and sped off into the night. Also, please. Do what I say, not what I do. Don’t drive high.

Delta-11 THC (Taken Orally as Delta-9 THC: 5-10mg, 10-60mg, “∞”) - I had to classify this one differently because Edibles are a whole other fucking drug compared to smoked Delta-9 THC. I’ve genuinely tripped sack on edibles. This shit can help you realize things, but it will get way too intense if you’re pushing it with your doses, even if in the end it’s helpful. For example, just the other night, I took 600mg and uncovered some repressed memories and trauma that I’m now finally able to start dealing with. So it can really help with some stuff, it is also one of THE most effective medicines out there for Pain, Insomnia, etc. All in all, this is a truly great drug.

4-aco-DMT (Taken Orally: 15-25mg, 25-40, 45+ ; Snorted: 5-10mg, 15-30mg, 35+) - This is basically shrooms again, but you can snort this shit. Ho-Ly Fuck. Ever wondered what shrooms up the nose would be like? Well now you can find out. 4-aco is, in my experience, indistinguishable from shrooms when taken orally. When snorted though, it’s a whole different beast. Experiencing an entire come up in the span of two minutes is enough to make anyone’s mind reel. Even drinking mushroom tea doesn’t compare to railing a line of 4-aco. You will trip balls.


**Opioids**

Tramadol (50-150mg, 150-250mg, 300mg) - This is probably an uncommon opinion, but this is my favorite opioid. I love tramadol. The serotonin action just leaves you feeling happy along with the incredible body feeling that comes with any opioid. Last time I took this drug I felt like I had take a low dose of molly with a little oxy. “Molly Percocet”

Fentanyl (idk, probably stay the fuck away from this one) - I never intended to try fentanyl. But as someone who does drugs fairly often, I was bound to run into it eventually. When I got my first dirty Oxy pill, it fucking sucked. The high lasted 10-15 minutes and then the comedown brought tons of nausea and a headache that lasted hours, or until you re-dosed. Second time I got it, I honestly liked it too much. It was like the cocaine of opioids. I could do a line every half hour and get that rush over and over again. I had to stop doing opioids all together after trying it for a second time. Fent IS too good.

Kratom Extract (How do they even dose this shit?) - Part of my issue with this is probably my lack of knowledge when it comes to dosing it. This shit FUCKED me up. At certain points it felt stronger than the fucking FENTANYL that I had done. That shit is not okay. Made me puke and dry heave so much, for hours. Only partly worth it. 7/10, will do again.

*Stimulants*

Vyvanse (30mg, 40-100mg, 100mg+) - Well, if we ignore the comedown. This is my favorite stim. First time I took it, I took 60mg. I spent a good 8 hours playing Red Dead Redemption 2, all the while messaging no less than 10 people at once. God that shit felt good. Only downside, other than the common shitty stimulant comedown, is that there’s no use in snorting it.

**Dissociatives**

Salvia (Just chew some leaves, or get the lowest level extract you can to smoke, and take one big hit.) - What the fuck. Of all the drugs I’ve done… This is the least comprehensible. I had a buddy who, on this stuff, became a goddamn box on a conveyer belt. When I did it the first time, I got stuck “between dimensions” and everything turned into diamonds. There is a high likely-hood that you will not enjoy this trip. I’ve only had a good trip maybe twice on salvia. But, I will say, every time I take this drug I learn something new. It definitely has value.

2F-DCK (20-50mg, 50-80mg, 80mg+) - This is literally just Ketamine. Although I’m sure to a more experienced disso user, there are obvious differences. But to me, they have the same effect. Super fun for a wonky evening with a few small lines. Or a good tool for an introspective nosedive into your own psyche. Good drug, do recommend.

**Benzodiazepines**

Just one more new one in this category;

Etizolam (0.5mg, 2mg, 3mg+) - This is a good one if you want some anxiety relief but don’t feel like you want to end up in jail. Now, any time you take enough of a benzo, there’s a decent chance your life takes a turn. But, Etiz is easily one of the safest benzos. I can’t stress enough that it’s still highly abusable, but it’s far less euphoric than most other Benzos, and I would say that’s the main perk to this drug.

157,q3oio4,Rossco2221,After my shroom experience weed is not the same.,"So nearly a year ago I took about 5 grams of dried shrooms. I took the shrooms the fight my depression I was dealing with for 9 years. It was recommended by someone I trust for a treatment to combat depression. Regrettably I didnt do much research and didnt apply much to my mood and setting. I smoked a blunt moments after I consumed all my shrooms because i didnt know what to expect and i wanted to be chill when the shrooms hit. So overall my shroom experience was bad. I started to feel weird and out of place so I go on my bed and just looked at the ceiling while listening to some music. Before long my stomachs started to hurt and my buddy (who took shrooms too) started to vomit. This is when my trip took a turn for the worse. I noticed that the shroom high was amplifying my emotions. I was worried for my buddy because she couldnt stop vomiting and I started to experience the sound of her vomiting as colors? Sounds weird I know but yeah...shrooms. anyway I remember getting cold sweats and a large amount of anxiety. I was also shivering uncontrollably....not pleasant in the slightest. I remember arguing with myself about calling an ambulance. I ultimately ended up not calling due to fear of getting in trouble. (This is also where a trip sitter would have come into play but alas I didnt do my research) after i peaked i didnt see anything crazy...no elves or tiny green men. I started to feel a bit better and the anxiety and vomiting disappeared. I remember wanting to strip naked and go do ""grass angles"" in the yard under the moon....and if I was drunk I might have done it...but shroom high was different I felt more concious and my decision making skills weren't too impaired. I really wanted to go out into the yard and see the moon. So I stepped outside and gazed at the moon for what felt like 5 mins. I then remember walking back into the house and my friend just informed me that the actor that played black panther died to cancer (Chadwick? I'm horrible with celebrity names)
At that moment I just burst out laughing...just uncontrollable laughter that I've never experienced. I understood what was being told to me and I knew the emotion I ""should"" have felt...sadness....but I just laughed like the joker who just pulled a fast one on batman. I went to go lay down in bed but the laughter wouldnt be suppressed. My body was convulsing so hard from me trying to suppress my laughter that my bed was shaking....I felt like I was going insane with laughter. I just wish i could remember what was so fucking funny. Anyway i remember telling my friend that shrooms were Loki's drug. Not once or twice...but a whole bunch of times...like I wouldnt shut up about it. After I started to come down from my high I remember looking up at the ceiling and seeing a thin film on the ceiling. It looked like geometric shapes jumping off the surface (just a few centimeters). They weren't moving. It almost looked like someone was shining an dim light through a col lida scope onto the ceiling. I fell asleep at this point and woke up feeling like shit. I had the shlits for about the first half of the day and the rest of the day was just recovering. Anyone off to the main point of this post.....after my trip I tried to smoke Mary Jane that night and had almost a full blown trip again.....like I was viewing myself in the 3rd person and I felt like reality was fake.....I mean the Mary  Jane was almost harsher than the fucking shrooms. The trip only lasted about an hour but fuck if it wasnt scary....my heart rate sky rocketed and I tried to meditate with no such luck. I honestly didnt know what happened and thought maybe it was just a fluke. So a few weeks later I try to smoke again. I took the past week off of Mary Jane because I was scared of what happened to me the week before. Welp this time the same shit happened...it was like I was tripping on shrooms once again. (I know I didnt mention this before but the past 3 years...up until this point i smoked every day hard. I spent loads of money on California weed. Wax carts and green were not foriegn to me. I'd spend upwards of $700 a month so I smoked hard. It was nothing for me to drain a cart in like 2 days) never....and I mean NEVER have I ever felt this way on weed or anywhere remotely close to this. The first time i smoked my friend had me hit 2 dabs in a row....i was fucking plastered but nothing like this. So fast forward a few months 2 or 3? I try Mary Jane again...but with caution....same ahit just not as intense because I went soft....wtf is going on? Later on (4 or 5 months after shrooms) i even try and 25mg CBD delta 8 gummy....and that shit fucked me up....i felt like i was tripping again on a fucking Delta 8 gummy. So it's been over a year now and I havent tried Mary Jane since my delta 8 experience....does anyone know what the fuck is going on? Please dont say it's a tolerance thing....I remember what it was like the first time I smoked....I got fucking lit and fast....its nothing like this. On a positive note: the shrooms have obliterated my depression....after 9 years of fighting depression I can final say I'm free of it. Also I'm no longer spending a huge chunk of $$$ on weed....but fuck I miss it and the way it made me feel. I remember being so much more immersed in movies and games while high...but I no longer feel that way when I smoke. I also forgot the mention that in the place of depression I now experience anxiety like never before. I've been successful in my meditation to combat this. I meditate for an hour daily and this truly helps my anxiety. It's almost like when I was depressed I ""flipped"" a switch in my brain and turned everything off...so I didnt feel anything...but once I took shrooms its like the switch got flipped back on and now I feel everything to what feels like the extreme....but I think it's the result of being ""turned off from life"" for so many years. Thanks for reading guys and let me know what you think. Also if you plan to do shrooms you should always have a trip sitter ( someone sober to watch over you) and you should plan out your trip. By plan out your trip I mean clear your activities for that day...dont have anything on your schedule....just chill time. And if you can make sure your mood is good because shrooms amplifies your feeling by a factor of 10 or 100....its nutz.

I took the shrooms the fight my depression I was dealing with for 9 years. It was recommended by someone I trust for a treatment to combat depression. Regrettably I didnt do much research and didnt apply much to my mood and setting. I smoked a blunt moments after I consumed all my shrooms because i didnt know what to expect and i wanted to be chill when the shrooms hit. So overall my shroom experience was bad. I started to feel weird and out of place so I go on my bed and just looked at the ceiling while listening to some music. Before long my stomachs started to hurt and my buddy (who took shrooms too) started to vomit. This is when my trip took a turn for the worse. I noticed that the shroom high was amplifying my emotions. I was worried for my buddy because she couldnt stop vomiting and I started to experience the sound of her vomiting as colors?

158,pa8bd0,Royal_Mcpoyle11,Cons of Marijuana (THC) Use,"Hello all,

Apologies for the incoming wall of text, but I’d like to express my thoughts regarding the negatives of using cannabis for me personally over the past decade and a half. 

I’ve been using marijuana since I was 15 years old, and I am now 30. That’s 15 years of use, and I feel as though i have a pretty good grasp on how cannabis effects me personally, both positive and negative. 90% of my use was smoked flower (bong) with the remaining 10% split evenly between dabs and edibles. I did take three long breaks during this 15 year span, a 6 month break in 2011, a 3 year break during 2014-2017, and a 1 year break from 2019 to 2020. I feel as though these breaks gave me an even greater perspective on the pros and cons and using cannabis. 

I’ll save the pros for another post, but let’s dive into the cons: 

Water retention/Aesthetic changes 

I’m a fitness addict and this is one of the most unfortunate side effects I notice personally. Regardless of the form of cannabis used (smoked or eaten), i notice an almost immediate and long lasting water retention effect. Please note that is absolutely, 100% regardless of calorie intake changes. Let’s say I don’t smoke for 1-3 days - boom, my physique and particularly my face appear much leaner and healthier (less dark circles under my eyes, less tired/haggard looking). Edibles are even worse, taking 250mg of delta 8 (heroic dose IMO, don’t do this) ensures i will be looking like absolute dogshit for the next 48 hours. 

I have no problem getting lean, but if I wanted to really get ‘shredded’ for the beach or a photoshoot, cutting out the cannabis would be the first thing I would do. Again, these changes occur regardless of calorie intake changes. Very unfortunate. I hypothesize this occurs due to systemic inflammation (I have asthma and chronic sinusitis and i notice smoking greatly increases the swelling in my sinuses and lungs, edibles are even WORSE believe it or not. Edibles completely plug up my nose, for whatever reason). Cannabis seems to simply seems to increase the amount of inflammation in my body, I can feel it. 

REM sleep:

Oh man. This has realistically got to be the worst health consequence of using cannabis for me personally. If I smoke right before bed and sleep 10 hours, it’s as if i didn’t sleep at all. This was most noticible to me after taking a long break from cannabis. This is also explains why after stopping its use, for about 2-4 weeks I am extremely tired and just want to sleep as much as possible (while having insanely vivid dreams). This seems to be a very common experience among users of this plant. Even if I smoke in the morning, my sleep is still affected for sure. 

Anxiety / depression / suicidical thoughts
Inability to sleep during ceased use 

This is a touchy subject but I can only speak for myself personally. During my most recent 1 year break, i remember consciously thinking to myself “Wow - I haven’t had a suicidal thought in many months - if i pick back up the weed, i need to be pay attention to any increases in these thoughts” Well, I did pick it back up, and i can say without a shadow of a doubt, cannabis use GREATLY increases these thoughts (particularly the next day after heavy use). Heavy edible abuse skyrockets the amount of these thoughts for me. I would never act on them, as I’m aware it’s simply from the drug, and they will subside after a period of sobriety, but i find this very interesting. Again, i believe anxiety/depression/suicidal thoughts are all related to inflammation in the brain, and cannabis seems to increase inflammation in my body. 

Anxiety/depression: This is very common knowledge IMO obviously but cannabis absolutely increases my baseline anxiety and depression, particularly while being abused. Again, this is probably a combination of factors, reduced REM sleep, inflammation, dopamine disregulation, etc. Taking magnesium helps greatly with the anxiety. It also helps me fall asleep during periods of abuse (for me personally, it’s actually harder to fall asleep when i’m high). This is probably due to melatonin production disregulation. Any time i begin to feel depressed about the future or myself, a break from the herb will fix this within 2-3 days, every time. 

I will note that while on a break, i will be manic after about 2-3 days of stopping use. This lasts for about 1-2 weeks. I am so eager for conversation, either in person or texting, that i struggle to classify this mind state as anything but a manic episode. I kind of enjoy this feeling as I am an introvert and normally hate talking to people in any capacity.  

Inability to sleep during abrupt cease of use:

This again is common knowledge but when ‘withdrawing’ from cannabis, it’s almost impossible for me to fall or stay asleep. This effect lasts about 2 weeks (of hell). A combination of melatonin and benedryl will knock me out during this time, but i find i wake up groggy.

161,pj9upi,Catber,I think I’m addicted to weed,I’m a senior in high school (18F) and I recently got REALLY into smoking. This summer was a very drug centric summer for me. I did a lot of experimenting and going to parties and chain smoking joints. I’ve been smoking since I was a freshman but only like once every 3 weeks. Then I started using delta 8 pens and I can’t stop. I’ve been high 24/7 for the past 2 weeks because pens are just so convenient. I’ve been high at school everyday for these 2 weeks and I’m terrified that I’m gonna ruin my brain. I’m especially afraid that my grades are gonna start slipping and I’m not gonna be able to hold the grades I need in order to get into the colleges I wanna go to. So if anyone knows how to reduce weed usage while still being able to enjoy it on the weekends and stuff please let me know.

So if anyone knows how to reduce weed usage while still being able to enjoy it on the weekends and stuff please let me know. Thank you in advance.</p>

166,q10czm,CreativeCorinne,Paranoia after weed (schizophrenia concern),"Hi! 

I'm a semi regular user of delta-8 edibles. I'm 18 so I can buy them ""legally"" (the place I bought them at cards but doesn't seem to care that the law says technically 21+). 

I have PTSD that I haven’t gotten around to getting a diagnosis for (it's because of a specific incident with my dad and I'm still on his health insurance so it's complicated). I use the edibles when I'm insanely stressed or when my mind decides to replay things I would rather not think about on repeat. 

I have a very low tolerance so the amount I take is the same strength (I did the math once) as the amount I take with delta-9 edibles (I miss you Vermont!!) (Half a square of a punch bar). 

Anyways, I've noticed that after I get high, for about a week I'm super paranoid and anxious about specific things. I live with roommates who I don't know well and I become convinced that if I walk across the apartment to use the bathroom, they will all judge me to be a terrible person. This gets to the point where I will literally pee in cups to avoid walking across the apartment. I also become convinced that if I talk to them they'll see me for the monster I truly am. I become really withdrawn and terrified to interact with my roomates. 

It only lasts for a week and I know this, but I'm going through it now and it's not fun. 

I also have a family history of schizophrenia. It's not in my direct line, but my grandma's only sibling and one of her daughters has it. 

I tend to figure that if weed was going to be my gateway to schizophrenia, it would have happened already (I've probably gotten high 15+ times), but as someone who also has a tendency to see faces in a shit ton of inanimate objects and to briefly see things that aren't there, as well as coming up into my peak schizophrenia ages, I figured it doesn't hurt to ask. 

Anyways, just wondering if this is something I should be concerned about? 

Also, are there any drugs that are good for dealing with PTSD flashbacks?",1633330955.0,,Cannabinoids,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/q10czm/paranoia_after_weed_schizophrenia_concern/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_11yti8,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Cannabinoids'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Cannabinoids,0,,,False,t3_q10czm,False,light,0.76,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi! </p>

172,pqx98f,5689AntiqueMission,What drug produces the greatest human pleasure?,"There are two things I'm trying to understand about pleasure and addiction. I'll start with this framework. Let's say -10 is the worst discomfort a person can experience, like all their pain receptors are firing at maximum. And +10 is the greatest pleasure a person can experience, like all the happy chemical receptors are saturated. And then 0 would be a neutral state, like sitting still while sober and engaging in no activity in particular.

I would say that the most positive pleasures I've personally experienced have been either the best orgasms or the best moments while on acid or DMT. How close these experiences are to a +10, I have no clue, as the theoretical maximum pleasure a human can experience is just that: theoretical. I just know that sex and psychedelics have taken me closest to +10.

1) My first question is whether we have any evidence that drugs produce the closest thing to +10 for humans, and which drugs produce the strongest positive deltas (regardless of the consequences after). For example, does heroin produce the closest effect to a +10?

2) My next question is to ask whether I'm understanding addiction correctly. Even though my top experiences have taken me to my own personal +10 or +X, there's no possibility of addiction to those experiences. On the other hand, I'm aware from reading lots of stories on reddit that heroin (and similar drugs) is very addicting.

This is entirely based on how I view the substances value recreationally, and does not go into their potential therapeutic value. This list is also ignoring the addiction potential/physical dangers of these substances, and purely rates how much I would enjoy a one time experience with any of these drugs/combos.

S tier- fucking love it, my favorite drugs

A tier- really like it, not as good as S tier

B  tier -  generally positive but sometimes inconsistent, I might say no to these drugs sometimes.

C tier - mixed experiences, can be positive or negative. I probably will try these drugs again at some point.

D tier - drugs I largely consider to be a waste or a negative experience. I probably won't do these again.

F tier - Fuck this shit, never again.

&#x200B;

S - Kava, MDMA+LSD, DXM+weed

A - LSD, oxycodone, mdma, ketamine

B - Mushrooms, Vyvanse, 2CB+weed, kratom, DXM+mushrooms

C - 2CB, THC, Delta-8, adderall, DXM, LSD+2CB

D - Cocaine, Alcohol, Klonopin, LSD+weed, hydrocodone

F - DPH, Xanax

&#x200B;

Explanations:

S - Candyflipping (LSD+MDMA) for sure has negatives but it's still S tier because of the strength of the euphoria. Never felt anything as euphoric, just absolute waves of bliss coming over me. Throwing up isn't as bad as on other drugs, and it's entirely worth it for the experience.

DXM and weed in my opinion is S tier, although I'm sure most people will disagree. I fucking love this combo like nothing else, they synergize very well and it is all around a very good time. The nausea does kinda suck but the weed largely takes away the nausea, and the dxm takes away the paranoia I usually get from weed. These substances together enhance music greatly, provide euphoria and a nice headspace, and largely cancel out each others negatives. This combo is kinda inconsistent, but that makes for a more interesting and novel experience imo, and I have yet to have a bad time on this combo. This combo is also super nostalgic, and on the afterglow sometimes I can enjoy certain types of music as if it were my first time listening to it. 

&#x200B;

A -  Kava to me is A tier because it has no negatives for me. Straight up just a good time. Feel good the next day, no withdrawal, no addiction. No negative effects and super comfortable.

 LSD used to be one of my favorites, but I had to drop it to A tier after some negative experiences and seeing both sides of the drug. A good LSD trip (for me) has great visuals and highly enhances music, and gives a childlike giddiness and energy. Having explored the substance more, I have had experiences with less music enhancement and visuals, which could be dose dependent, so the main reason this substance is A tier is because of the anxiety associated with it. LSD also often makes me feel just uncomfortable physically, with a weird taste in my mouth and nausea throughout the trip. Still, LSD, as well as 2CB and mushrooms, makes me think in a way I really like, in this insane weird way where all my thoughts have patterns and loops and shit. Talking to people while tripping is fun asf.

Oxycodone is very euphoric, but in a pretty flat way, meaning that instead of increasing how music sounds or increasing enjoyment from certain activities, it just makes you feel better. The euphoria is strong, but I personally prefer substances that enhance music or provide interesting visuals. Regardless, the euphoria from oxy is enough for me to justify putting it in the A tier, and I have not experienced many negatives from it.

MDMA - super fucking euphoric. Can have shitty comedowns, but I haven't had many. The biggest downside, for me at least, is that it does not last very long in comparison to other drugs I enjoy. Still super fun and enhances music a lot.

Ketamine would probably be higher on the list if I tried it more times, but I have only had one experience with it so I cannot comfortably put it in the S tier. I fucking loved it though. It didn't exactly have 'euphoria' in the traditional sense like oxy or mdma, but I definitely felt better than usual. It made me enjoy very specific music, and some music sounded significantly worse than usual. I enjoyed the headspace a lot though, and the visuals were subtle but nice. Nothing about the experience was negative or overwhelming, and I was very comfortable the whole time. I also enjoy the out of body feelings and strong dissociation. Not really any negatives and a very interesting experience.

&#x200B;

B - Kratom is enjoyable to me, even though it is a pretty weak substance I have a lot of fun on it. It's not an overwhelming or forced feeling, which makes it more enjoyable to me, and it adjusts things just enough that everything is okay, and right. I feel entirely content on it. There aren't really any negatives that I have experienced during the high, but it is not a strong enough feeling to justify putting it in A tier.

Mushrooms are pretty inconsistent for me, which is why they are ranked lower than acid. Sometimes they have nice visuals and an interesting headspace, and sometimes they are just physically uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. The nausea and body load can be a bit much on mushrooms, and they often don't have the euphoria or visuals to make it worth it. The nausea also doesn't go away during the peak like dxm, it stays for the whole time, in my experience. Still, mushrooms are an enjoyable high when I'm prepared for them and take the right dose for me.

Vyvanse is probably my favorite recreational stimulant, and I can't really describe exactly why. I just enjoy the vibe of it a little more than adderall. Adderall makes me feel geeked, and vyvanse makes me feel just elevated. I can get more euphoria out of it with less anxiety. I also get a fucking huge ego boost from it. I feel like I can do fucking anything.

2CB+weed gets me absolutely fucking sent. It is an uncomfortable experience sometimes, but it fucking delivers. Time slows down to half, my vision is filled by fractals, music sounds completely different, and it wears off in time for me to sleep. I get some hppd type symptoms the next day, but besides that it's a great time. The auditory hallucinations can be a little much sometimes, but it's still a cool experience that consistently gets me high enough every time and gives enough visuals and distortions for things to be entertaining.

DXM+mushrooms - This combo is something I have not tried a lot, but it can be fun for sure. The biggest thing is being careful about dosage, as I prefer a decent dose of dxm and a low dose of shrooms to kick things up a notch. I want to try this again to get a better opinion of it.

&#x200B;

C - DXM, one of my favorites, but ultimately isn't super interesting on its own. I enjoy dxm, but it isnt super euphoric or visual alone, and the nausea often overwhelms a lot of the other sensations. DXM can still provide an interesting experience alone though, in my opinion, as it can still enhance music a decent amount and provide feelings of nostalgia and dissociation. DXM often does not get me to the level of high I want to be when I take it alone.

2CB alone is an interesting substance, but pales in comparison to the experiences I have had with other psychedelics at the end of the day. 2CB isn't that visual, and isn't particularly interesting to experience. I prefer 2CB during the day for sure, and it can enhance music and provide a weird euphoria, a little like empathogens, but not exactly. 2CB is also not a super comfortable drug, and the body high is pretty trippy and sometimes can be hard to deal with, as it makes me feel almost pain in parts of my body.

THC is a substance I have had a very back and forth relationship with, as I usually either am addicted to it or entirely despise the high, but I have come to a sort of middle ground lately. THC causes me more paranoia and anxiety than most psychedelics do on their own, and does not have visuals that compare to them. For me, the negatives of THC come up before the things that I enjoy about it (when increasing dose. Not sure if that makes sense at all). It makes me extremely tired, absolutely fucks my memory, and the body high can be intense, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. That being said, I kind of enjoy the discomfort sometimes, the tweaked out body high is something I usually look back upon fondly. THC also provides a decent amount of music euphoria, which is the thing I look for most in drugs. Overall, is a very mixed bag for me, and has more negatives and more positives than most drugs on this list. Weed can get me high enough, but it often makes me wish I didn't. I do find weed visuals to be interesting, but they are often dull (as in not vibrant, not like lsd) and hard to remember.

Delta-8 is pretty similar to weed, except that instead of getting me too high and uncomfortable, it usually doesn't get me high enough and isn't too uncomfortable. To me, it's a cleaner, more stimulating weed high, but doesn't have that spacy feeling that I enjoy from weed.

Adderall can be enjoyable, but sometimes it makes me aggressive as fuck, and recently has been dysphoric at times, but I was also prescribed it for a year and a half so I probably fucked my tolerance to it. Adderall when I started taking it wasn't exactly fun, but it did have some numbness/euphoria to it that I enjoyed. It makes me not feel much which I enjoy, but the negatives kinda suck and make a C tier drug. I can't eat, can't sleep, am angry asf sometimes, and sometimes it's just straight up a negative experience.

LSD+2CB - another combo I haven't tried much and need to research more. I've definitely noticed that I need to dose the 2cb pretty early, as I dosed after the acid peak and it did nothing but make me feel a bit dehydrated. When I aligned the peak it was super confusing at first, a lot of anxiety, but then it faded away to some of the coolest visuals I've ever had. This was after the peak, so I had the calm, super open feeling I get after the acid peak, and some of the best visuals I've ever had. Aztec writing was everywhere, and people looked super weird, but also beautiful.

&#x200B;

D - Hydrocodone - This shit never really hit for me. Every time I took it I either felt bored or I felt straight fucked up, but I never actually felt good, I just felt like a retard. It either just chilled me out slightly or made me not know what the fuck was happening. Not really a super enjoyable drug in my opinion, but I would try it again, because my 'research' is fairly limited on this drug.

Cocaine kinda sucks. Feels great for like 20 minutes, then just feel shaky and fucked up after. Fuck cocaine. Not really an enjoyable experience, doesn't even have euphoria on the same level as most other drugs for me. Maybe it just doesn't hit because I have ADHD and stims aren't that fun in general for me, but still, fuck coke.

Alcohol, the one everyone on here fucking hates. Alcohol usually just makes me straight retarded and slightly horny. I've had a few good times being stupid asf with friends, singing while wasted, that sort of shit, and I had one time where I had some legit euphoria that I could compare to other harder drugs, but still, eh. Not super interesting, no real improvement to music, unpredictable euphoria, and I don't like feeling just retarded.

Klonopin didn't really do anything to me besides make me a little tired and chilled out, its almost not worth considering. It's not an F tier because it wasn't a negative experience, but it also wasn't really much of an experience at all.

LSD+weed, I feel like a lot of people will disagree but I fucking hate this feeling. ime the weed does not potentiate the acid visuals, but just makes them more dull and less vibrant. It makes me more tired, and changes the headspace so that I feel super confused and entirely unable to think straight. I know some fucker is gonna say ""just relax bro, let the experience happen"", but I just don't enjoy feeling this retarded, and I have never had a good time mixing these overall. The only reason it isn't F tier is because I've had a few good moments with these trips, which are worth taking into account, but the overall experience has always been more negative than positive.

&#x200B;

F tier - the drugs that I fucking hate and wish I never did.

Xanax. Fucking xanax. I have no goddamn clue how anyone enjoys this drug. My xanax experiences have always been not remembering shit and not feeling any euphoria at all. Shit makes me retarded, tired as hell, and is not enjoyable at all to experience. Fuck Xanax. I did this at school once, and I remember like 5-10 minutes of every class, and I felt like time was skipping for me, Couldn't function at all, I'm lucky as hell I didn't get caught. Only positive was that I missed a school day

DPH, benadryl, the true devil's drug if there is one. Fuck this shit. First drug I ever tried and I did this shit way too often. I liked the lower doses, because I would nod out and be in a dream like state, but anything about like 200 mg is literal hell. Like exactly what I imagine hell would be like. It puts you into a state of fear and panic, if you don't black out entirely. Like true primal fucking fear. The 'visuals' are usually just not knowing wtf is around you, and seeing shadow people, which is not as cool as I thought it sounded when I was a dumbass 14 year old kid. I've seen cuts all along my arms on this shit, seen demons rape me, blacked out entirely. This drug has almost no purpose, unless you get bit by ants or some shit. The body load is awful, and it gives this weird nausea/feeling in your throat I can't describe well. It also makes me go a little insane, I remember getting into fights with all my friends, losing my shit, because of this shit.

Well, that's all the drugs and combos that I felt were worth mentioning that I have done.

This is entirely based on how I view the substances value recreationally, and does not go into their potential therapeutic value. This list is also ignoring the addiction potential/physical dangers of these substances, and purely rates how much I would enjoy a one time experience with any of these drugs/combos.</p>

<p>S tier- fucking love it, my favorite drugs</p>

<p>A tier- really like it, not as good as S tier</p>

<p>B  tier -  generally positive but sometimes inconsistent, I might say no to these drugs sometimes.</p>

<p>C tier - mixed experiences, can be positive or negative. I probably will try these drugs again at some point.</p>

<p>D tier - drugs I largely consider to be a waste or a negative experience. I probably won&#39;t do these again.</p>

<p>F tier - Fuck this shit, never again.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>S - Kava, MDMA+LSD, DXM+weed</p>

<p>A - LSD, oxycodone, mdma, ketamine</p>

<p>B - Mushrooms, Vyvanse, 2CB+weed, kratom, DXM+mushrooms</p>

<p>C - 2CB, THC, Delta-8, adderall, DXM, LSD+2CB</p>

<p>D - Cocaine, Alcohol, Klonopin, LSD+weed, hydrocodone</p>

<p>F - DPH, Xanax</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Explanations:</p>

<p>S - Candyflipping (LSD+MDMA) for sure has negatives but it&#39;s still S tier because of the strength of the euphoria. Never felt anything as euphoric, just absolute waves of bliss coming over me. Throwing up isn&#39;t as bad as on other drugs, and it&#39;s entirely worth it for the experience.</p>

<p>DXM and weed in my opinion is S tier, although I&#39;m sure most people will disagree. I fucking love this combo like nothing else, they synergize very well and it is all around a very good time. The nausea does kinda suck but the weed largely takes away the nausea, and the dxm takes away the paranoia I usually get from weed. These substances together enhance music greatly, provide euphoria and a nice headspace, and largely cancel out each others negatives. This combo is kinda inconsistent, but that makes for a more interesting and novel experience imo, and I have yet to have a bad time on this combo. This combo is also super nostalgic, and on the afterglow sometimes I can enjoy certain types of music as if it were my first time listening to it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>A -  Kava to me is A tier because it has no negatives for me. Straight up just a good time. Feel good the next day, no withdrawal, no addiction. No negative effects and super comfortable.</p>

<p>LSD used to be one of my favorites, but I had to drop it to A tier after some negative experiences and seeing both sides of the drug. A good LSD trip (for me) has great visuals and highly enhances music, and gives a childlike giddiness and energy. Having explored the substance more, I have had experiences with less music enhancement and visuals, which could be dose dependent, so the main reason this substance is A tier is because of the anxiety associated with it. LSD also often makes me feel just uncomfortable physically, with a weird taste in my mouth and nausea throughout the trip. Still, LSD, as well as 2CB and mushrooms, makes me think in a way I really like, in this insane weird way where all my thoughts have patterns and loops and shit. Talking to people while tripping is fun asf.</p>

<p>Oxycodone is very euphoric, but in a pretty flat way, meaning that instead of increasing how music sounds or increasing enjoyment from certain activities, it just makes you feel better. The euphoria is strong, but I personally prefer substances that enhance music or provide interesting visuals. Regardless, the euphoria from oxy is enough for me to justify putting it in the A tier, and I have not experienced many negatives from it.</p>

<p>MDMA - super fucking euphoric. Can have shitty comedowns, but I haven&#39;t had many. The biggest downside, for me at least, is that it does not last very long in comparison to other drugs I enjoy. Still super fun and enhances music a lot.</p>

<p>Ketamine would probably be higher on the list if I tried it more times, but I have only had one experience with it so I cannot comfortably put it in the S tier. I fucking loved it though. It didn&#39;t exactly have &#39;euphoria&#39; in the traditional sense like oxy or mdma, but I definitely felt better than usual. It made me enjoy very specific music, and some music sounded significantly worse than usual. I enjoyed the headspace a lot though, and the visuals were subtle but nice. Nothing about the experience was negative or overwhelming, and I was very comfortable the whole time. I also enjoy the out of body feelings and strong dissociation. Not really any negatives and a very interesting experience.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>B - Kratom is enjoyable to me, even though it is a pretty weak substance I have a lot of fun on it. It&#39;s not an overwhelming or forced feeling, which makes it more enjoyable to me, and it adjusts things just enough that everything is okay, and right. I feel entirely content on it. There aren&#39;t really any negatives that I have experienced during the high, but it is not a strong enough feeling to justify putting it in A tier.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are pretty inconsistent for me, which is why they are ranked lower than acid. Sometimes they have nice visuals and an interesting headspace, and sometimes they are just physically uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. The nausea and body load can be a bit much on mushrooms, and they often don&#39;t have the euphoria or visuals to make it worth it. The nausea also doesn&#39;t go away during the peak like dxm, it stays for the whole time, in my experience. Still, mushrooms are an enjoyable high when I&#39;m prepared for them and take the right dose for me.</p>

<p>Vyvanse is probably my favorite recreational stimulant, and I can&#39;t really describe exactly why. I just enjoy the vibe of it a little more than adderall. Adderall makes me feel geeked, and vyvanse makes me feel just elevated. I can get more euphoria out of it with less anxiety. I also get a fucking huge ego boost from it. I feel like I can do fucking anything.</p>

<p>2CB+weed gets me absolutely fucking sent. It is an uncomfortable experience sometimes, but it fucking delivers. Time slows down to half, my vision is filled by fractals, music sounds completely different, and it wears off in time for me to sleep. I get some hppd type symptoms the next day, but besides that it&#39;s a great time. The auditory hallucinations can be a little much sometimes, but it&#39;s still a cool experience that consistently gets me high enough every time and gives enough visuals and distortions for things to be entertaining.</p>

<p>DXM+mushrooms - This combo is something I have not tried a lot, but it can be fun for sure. The biggest thing is being careful about dosage, as I prefer a decent dose of dxm and a low dose of shrooms to kick things up a notch. I want to try this again to get a better opinion of it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>C - DXM, one of my favorites, but ultimately isn&#39;t super interesting on its own. I enjoy dxm, but it isnt super euphoric or visual alone, and the nausea often overwhelms a lot of the other sensations. DXM can still provide an interesting experience alone though, in my opinion, as it can still enhance music a decent amount and provide feelings of nostalgia and dissociation. DXM often does not get me to the level of high I want to be when I take it alone.</p>

<p>2CB alone is an interesting substance, but pales in comparison to the experiences I have had with other psychedelics at the end of the day. 2CB isn&#39;t that visual, and isn&#39;t particularly interesting to experience. I prefer 2CB during the day for sure, and it can enhance music and provide a weird euphoria, a little like empathogens, but not exactly. 2CB is also not a super comfortable drug, and the body high is pretty trippy and sometimes can be hard to deal with, as it makes me feel almost pain in parts of my body.</p>

<p>THC is a substance I have had a very back and forth relationship with, as I usually either am addicted to it or entirely despise the high, but I have come to a sort of middle ground lately. THC causes me more paranoia and anxiety than most psychedelics do on their own, and does not have visuals that compare to them. For me, the negatives of THC come up before the things that I enjoy about it (when increasing dose. Not sure if that makes sense at all). It makes me extremely tired, absolutely fucks my memory, and the body high can be intense, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. That being said, I kind of enjoy the discomfort sometimes, the tweaked out body high is something I usually look back upon fondly. THC also provides a decent amount of music euphoria, which is the thing I look for most in drugs. Overall, is a very mixed bag for me, and has more negatives and more positives than most drugs on this list. Weed can get me high enough, but it often makes me wish I didn&#39;t. I do find weed visuals to be interesting, but they are often dull (as in not vibrant, not like lsd) and hard to remember.</p>

<p>Delta-8 is pretty similar to weed, except that instead of getting me too high and uncomfortable, it usually doesn&#39;t get me high enough and isn&#39;t too uncomfortable. To me, it&#39;s a cleaner, more stimulating weed high, but doesn&#39;t have that spacy feeling that I enjoy from weed.</p>

<p>Adderall can be enjoyable, but sometimes it makes me aggressive as fuck, and recently has been dysphoric at times, but I was also prescribed it for a year and a half so I probably fucked my tolerance to it. Adderall when I started taking it wasn&#39;t exactly fun, but it did have some numbness/euphoria to it that I enjoyed. It makes me not feel much which I enjoy, but the negatives kinda suck and make a C tier drug. I can&#39;t eat, can&#39;t sleep, am angry asf sometimes, and sometimes it&#39;s just straight up a negative experience.</p>

<p>LSD+2CB - another combo I haven&#39;t tried much and need to research more. I&#39;ve definitely noticed that I need to dose the 2cb pretty early, as I dosed after the acid peak and it did nothing but make me feel a bit dehydrated. When I aligned the peak it was super confusing at first, a lot of anxiety, but then it faded away to some of the coolest visuals I&#39;ve ever had. This was after the peak, so I had the calm, super open feeling I get after the acid peak, and some of the best visuals I&#39;ve ever had. Aztec writing was everywhere, and people looked super weird, but also beautiful.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>D - Hydrocodone - This shit never really hit for me. Every time I took it I either felt bored or I felt straight fucked up, but I never actually felt good, I just felt like a retard. It either just chilled me out slightly or made me not know what the fuck was happening. Not really a super enjoyable drug in my opinion, but I would try it again, because my &#39;research&#39; is fairly limited on this drug.</p>

<p>Cocaine kinda sucks. Feels great for like 20 minutes, then just feel shaky and fucked up after. Fuck cocaine. Not really an enjoyable experience, doesn&#39;t even have euphoria on the same level as most other drugs for me. Maybe it just doesn&#39;t hit because I have ADHD and stims aren&#39;t that fun in general for me, but still, fuck coke.</p>

<p>Alcohol, the one everyone on here fucking hates. Alcohol usually just makes me straight retarded and slightly horny. I&#39;ve had a few good times being stupid asf with friends, singing while wasted, that sort of shit, and I had one time where I had some legit euphoria that I could compare to other harder drugs, but still, eh. Not super interesting, no real improvement to music, unpredictable euphoria, and I don&#39;t like feeling just retarded.</p>

<p>Klonopin didn&#39;t really do anything to me besides make me a little tired and chilled out, its almost not worth considering. It&#39;s not an F tier because it wasn&#39;t a negative experience, but it also wasn&#39;t really much of an experience at all.</p>

<p>LSD+weed, I feel like a lot of people will disagree but I fucking hate this feeling. ime the weed does not potentiate the acid visuals, but just makes them more dull and less vibrant. It makes me more tired, and changes the headspace so that I feel super confused and entirely unable to think straight. I know some fucker is gonna say &quot;just relax bro, let the experience happen&quot;, but I just don&#39;t enjoy feeling this retarded, and I have never had a good time mixing these overall. The only reason it isn&#39;t F tier is because I&#39;ve had a few good moments with these trips, which are worth taking into account, but the overall experience has always been more negative than positive.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>F tier - the drugs that I fucking hate and wish I never did.</p>

<p>Xanax. Fucking xanax. I have no goddamn clue how anyone enjoys this drug. My xanax experiences have always been not remembering shit and not feeling any euphoria at all. Shit makes me retarded, tired as hell, and is not enjoyable at all to experience. Fuck Xanax. I did this at school once, and I remember like 5-10 minutes of every class, and I felt like time was skipping for me, Couldn&#39;t function at all, I&#39;m lucky as hell I didn&#39;t get caught. Only positive was that I missed a school day</p>

<p>DPH, benadryl, the true devil&#39;s drug if there is one. Fuck this shit. First drug I ever tried and I did this shit way too often. I liked the lower doses, because I would nod out and be in a dream like state, but anything about like 200 mg is literal hell. Like exactly what I imagine hell would be like. It puts you into a state of fear and panic, if you don&#39;t black out entirely. Like true primal fucking fear. The &#39;visuals&#39; are usually just not knowing wtf is around you, and seeing shadow people, which is not as cool as I thought it sounded when I was a dumbass 14 year old kid. I&#39;ve seen cuts all along my arms on this shit, seen demons rape me, blacked out entirely. This drug has almost no purpose, unless you get bit by ants or some shit. The body load is awful, and it gives this weird nausea/feeling in your throat I can&#39;t describe well. It also makes me go a little insane, I remember getting into fights with all my friends, losing my shit, because of this shit.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

I don't really smoke delta 9 because it gives me really strong anxiety. I've smoked d8 a few times and there is still a bit but its manageable so i can still enjoy it.

Do you think the anxiety could come back in higher doses?


I want to try a few more low doses to feel it out first, but some time soon i want to go all out and take a really big dose. I've heard of people having crazy experiences with oral thc and want to see what its about.

179,mipw8p,2cbthrowmeaway,Spice is flooding the UK in both bud and vape juice. Here are a few tips to help you tell you what your getting and a plan for any accidental / purposeful users to quit as painlessly as.possible.,"This is the cycle of every spice user I know. Short high, high euphoria, low price and easy to convince self its weed. The cycle: Question it the first time but enjoying it -> using daily due to convinience -> you start to enjoy this more than weed / just as much / in my friends case he loved the almost disso effects when at extreme doses -> chaining 15 in a row every night before bed (big 2ml tank, high watts clearing through a tank an evening and vaping all day) -> waking up to vape in the middle of night. -> finally realising it's not weed.

Spice is problematic because it could be any one of 1000s of chemicals so each one has there own positives and negatives. But most are full agonists to the cannabinoid  receptors rather than the partial agonist of weed. I don't know what this means other than it most likely makes it neurotoxic and have physical withdrawal symptoms. Some feel almost exactly like weed at low doses, others are more psychedelic and dissociative.

I'm making this post as 2 people close to me were addicted and 3 people that I know loosely have vaped it without knowing. It also happened to me two years ago with vape juice. I have talked to 3 accidental spice users on here in 2 days, and I barely scroll through this sub anymore.

Even the most experienced stoner can be deceived because it can be sprayed onto bud (I had only heard of this happening in Germany until today from the RC sub being bombarded with questions) until today where I just talked to a guy who reported exactly what is to be expected from laced weed. I've asked him to send it for testing but it's a big step and most people don't (I didn't I just binned it). https://www.reddit.com/r/uktrees/comments/milz7y/weed_taste_like_bleachchemicals/gt5pbn9?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Also can be added to a vape mix of with cannabis terps/flavourings/thickeners(not seen this last one personally). Some is just added to normal ejuice / unflavoured ejuice and that is much easier to spot.

The ejuice problem is seriously bad in my area and apparently flows freely through highschools and most don't have any other experiences but this.



Tips to spot spice?

For bud your looking for a chemical aftertaste and a shorter / more intense / possibly psychedelic high but not necessarily psychedelic.

Vape juice is harder and easier depending how they make it and the price it's sold. 10ml for 20-30£ thin and I'm willing to bet at 85% certainty it's synthetic, even if it tastes like a strain. 

Anything that is clear (mainly if its thin due to delta-8 being sold cheaply legally in the us for a while and now it's more controlled its being exported, but d8 is more mild and matches THC juice in that its usually thick). 

Anything without a strain name but instead a flavour 'bubblegum' 'strawberry' 'blue fusion' etc.

Things to do if your not sure. Send a small sample to WEDINOS testing. It's free and it will ease your mind if it is legit and force your hand if it is not.

Go to www.wedinos.org and type in THC vape juice. You will see 90% tested are synthetic. Go to page 6 to see the most updated samples, you will see the wild combination of Chems people are smoking.

First of many spice hashes to be tested I'm sure.

My advice for current spice users? 

Make THC vape juice in carts (make em strong or weak up to you) your gonna be sad how many ml you get. Buy a 0.5ml ceramic cart. 1G wax (25-40£) makes like 2-5 carts depending on method (you can make em way weaker and use in bigger vapes too but doesn't work as well imo).

https://www.reddit.com/r/cleancarts/comments/cmzrxk/making_your_own_at_home/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Ive used method 1, 2, 4 and 5 tried one made with 3 but it tasted like it was made with abv. I prefer 2 and the PEG mix for 5. With that I used to make some 200mg/ml stuff for a big tank with only the shatter flavouring. Mixed the peg mix with 1:1 shatter and added pure PG to that mixture and it stayed mixed.

Next you wanna be buying some CBD vape juice for the compulsive vape habit you have most likely picked up. Also slightly anti-anxiety, cheap and available legally in UK. You can get a 1g of CBD isolate vape juice (10-20ml of juice depending on strength) for less than 30. Or buy 1G of CBD isolate for around 15-20 and just drop that in normal flavoured ejuice (200mg/ml is my preference, 50-100 works).

Short high, high euphoria, low price and easy to convince self its weed. The cycle: Question it the first time but enjoying it -&gt; using daily due to convinience -&gt; you start to enjoy this more than weed / just as much / in my friends case he loved the almost disso effects when at extreme doses -&gt; chaining 15 in a row every night before bed (big 2ml tank, high watts clearing through a tank an evening and vaping all day) -&gt; waking up to vape in the middle of night. -&gt; finally realising it&#39;s not weed.</p>

<p>Spice is problematic because it could be any one of 1000s of chemicals so each one has there own positives and negatives. But most are full agonists to the cannabinoid  receptors rather than the partial agonist of weed. I don&#39;t know what this means other than it most likely makes it neurotoxic and have physical withdrawal symptoms. Some feel almost exactly like weed at low doses, others are more psychedelic and dissociative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m making this post as 2 people close to me were addicted and 3 people that I know loosely have vaped it without knowing. It also happened to me two years ago with vape juice. I have talked to 3 accidental spice users on here in 2 days, and I barely scroll through this sub anymore.</p>

<p>Even the most experienced stoner can be deceived because it can be sprayed onto bud (I had only heard of this happening in Germany until today from the RC sub being bombarded with questions) until today where I just talked to a guy who reported exactly what is to be expected from laced weed. I&#39;ve asked him to send it for testing but it&#39;s a big step and most people don&#39;t (I didn&#39;t I just binned it). <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/uktrees/comments/milz7y/weed_taste_like_bleachchemicals/gt5pbn9?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3"">https://www.reddit.com/r/uktrees/comments/milz7y/weed_taste_like_bleachchemicals/gt5pbn9?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3</a></p>

<p>Also can be added to a vape mix of with cannabis terps/flavourings/thickeners(not seen this last one personally). Some is just added to normal ejuice / unflavoured ejuice and that is much easier to spot.</p>

<p>The ejuice problem is seriously bad in my area and apparently flows freely through highschools and most don&#39;t have any other experiences but this.</p>

<p>Tips to spot spice?</p>

<p>For bud your looking for a chemical aftertaste and a shorter / more intense / possibly psychedelic high but not necessarily psychedelic.</p>

<p>Vape juice is harder and easier depending how they make it and the price it&#39;s sold. 10ml for 20-30£ thin and I&#39;m willing to bet at 85% certainty it&#39;s synthetic, even if it tastes like a strain. </p>

<p>Anything that is clear (mainly if its thin due to delta-8 being sold cheaply legally in the us for a while and now it&#39;s more controlled its being exported, but d8 is more mild and matches THC juice in that its usually thick). </p>

<p>Anything without a strain name but instead a flavour &#39;bubblegum&#39; &#39;strawberry&#39; &#39;blue fusion&#39; etc.</p>

<p>Things to do if your not sure. Send a small sample to WEDINOS testing. It&#39;s free and it will ease your mind if it is legit and force your hand if it is not.</p>

<p>Go to <a href=""http://www.wedinos.org"">www.wedinos.org</a> and type in THC vape juice. You will see 90% tested are synthetic. Go to page 6 to see the most updated samples, you will see the wild combination of Chems people are smoking.</p>

<p>First of many spice hashes to be tested I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>My advice for current spice users? </p>

<p>Make THC vape juice in carts (make em strong or weak up to you) your gonna be sad how many ml you get. Buy a 0.5ml ceramic cart. 1G wax (25-40£) makes like 2-5 carts depending on method (you can make em way weaker and use in bigger vapes too but doesn&#39;t work as well imo).</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/cleancarts/comments/cmzrxk/making_your_own_at_home/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share"">https://www.reddit.com/r/cleancarts/comments/cmzrxk/making_your_own_at_home/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a></p>

<p>Ive used method 1, 2, 4 and 5 tried one made with 3 but it tasted like it was made with abv. I prefer 2 and the PEG mix for 5. With that I used to make some 200mg/ml stuff for a big tank with only the shatter flavouring. Mixed the peg mix with 1:1 shatter and added pure PG to that mixture and it stayed mixed.</p>

<p>Next you wanna be buying some CBD vape juice for the compulsive vape habit you have most likely picked up. Also slightly anti-anxiety, cheap and available legally in UK. You can get a 1g of CBD isolate vape juice (10-20ml of juice depending on strength) for less than 30. Or buy 1G of CBD isolate for around 15-20 and just drop that in normal flavoured ejuice (200mg/ml is my preference, 50-100 works). </p>

<p>Tldr. Buy / make real weed carts to get high. Use CBD vape juice when you want to compulsively hit your vape.</p>

188,lc0p7x,inlovewithcid,Every drug Ive ever done (age 17),"Some people might think im makin this shit up but i really just wanna express about my drug use. I don't have too much trouble friends wise, but half of them would freak out and try to get me sent back to treatment and the other half just wouldnt care(or already know). 

MY BACKGROUND:

I was a really good and smart kid growing up. I always had the best grades, got along with everybody, never got in trouble with anyone, always on good terms with parents. I was the kind of kid you would assume would have a phd as an adult.

I was also a very emotional kid with lots of bad mood swings. At the same time i was always happy. Shit started to hit the fan in middle school. It seemed like three years of punishment by god. Parents got divorced, my best friend got stabbed to death at 13, i was bullied constantly, dealing with terrible step parents, i found out about self-harm, i was diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc etc. 

I was really takin a lot of punches from life. I was always super interested in substances from a relatively young age. I would spend hours on end watching youtube videos about psychedelics and weed before anyone my age even knew what they were. I never actually seeked them out till i was 13. I looked through every cabinet in my moms apartment and looked up every drug name on the bottles to see if it could fuck me up. What i scored with was celexa, hydrocodone, and valium. This was pretty much the death of my innocence.

It took 1 week until i was hospitalized for valium (was a safe dosage but my ). Im gonna give some highlights in the last few years: lost another great friend after he took his own life, have been legitimately addicted to several substances, i thought i watched my mom die because of my drug use(long story she thought she was having a heart attack but was ok after she arrived at the hospital), attempted to end my life 2 times, and was sent to an abusive long term treatment center. I now have a full time job which is how i can afford to buy all of the substances in my list.

DRUGS IVE DONE:
In no order

ALCOHOL - Straight dog shit. Fun in some situations but otherwise I'd rather do anything else.

NICOTINE - Always called my friends fags for doing nic. But then i tried it recently and i loved it for a week. But after ~4 months its actually getting difficult for me to quit. At the bottom of my list of drugs i need to quit however.

CANNABINOIDS - THC, Delta 8, possibly done spice/been served pesticide pack. 

Unlike most people weed was not my first drug. Ive always enjoyed smoking and used to try to be one of those stoners that revolve their life around it. Now i can take it or leave it. It is nice to have at times. 

BENZOS - 
Valium - First drug and it was so mind blowing at the time to me, bc of my anxiety and 0 experience 

Klonopin - Nice novelty experience in my opinion but just a benzo at the end of the day

Xanax - Went through 100 bars in less than 2 months when i was 14 which gave me my first taste of withdrawal. Not the hardest thing to kick but def wasnt fun. And i was using for a p short time so i wouldnt expect any crazy withdrawals.

Fenty pressed bar - Shitty press. Never even seen pictures of bars this tall, it was chalky asf, faded yellow bus, and tasted like nothing. Ate a quarter and have no recollection of that night. Not my proudest moment. *not actual fent lol*


OPIATES - 
Hydrocodone - First opiate, i actually loved it but had no reference at the time

Percocet- Perc 10s very nice, somehow never got in trouble for nodding in class lol

Oxycodone - M30s probably presses but felt same as percs

Tramadol - Made me very nauseous and not very euphoric but not the worst thing

Opiates were never really my kind of thing. First real euphoric drug experience. When i used to seek them out it was a pretty difficult habit to hold due to price, also it was v hard to find a plug that would sell a 14 year old opiates lmfao. Now that i have access to a decent amount of money im glad i better understand these drugs' consequences. I have no will to dabble in this class of drugs again.

STIMULANTS💕 - 
Vyvanse - First stim, love at first taste

Adderall - Not bad, but i prefer vyvanse

Prescription Meth - Felt more euphoric than adderall but that could have been placebo. Adderall+

Coke - not the worst but it's objectively low tier

3mmc - idk why people say its better than coke. Its pretty ass. I flushed 5gs. Then i figured i should give it another shot and i cant force myself to like it.

Nep - Cocaine but more euphoric, wayyyyy cheaper, longer duration but also convenient duration, but it is fiendish asf.

2-fma - I think this was my first Rc i ever bought and i was not disappointed. Pure functionality, even when i get worried that I might've snorted too much.

3-fpm - i quit stims for a few months after i had some scary heart symptoms after daily use for a while. IM ONLY FUCKING 17 AND I WAS SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE. Currently back on stims but these haven't returned thankfully. This was a little too much euphoria. Was still very functional but i liked it too much.

Ipph - Fantastic caffeine RC. I just looove doing lines of a substance only to feel like i had a single cup of coffee.

Benzedrex - more euphoria than mdma for me. But felt like hell at the same time. 

Mdma - i honestly dont know if this is the right category. But my first time trying real mdma was so magical. Each time i do it is like having the best therapy session of my life while also wanting to bust in my pants. My friends dont roll w me anymore...

 DISSOCIATIVES🛸-

Dxm - first disso, but never really tripped bc of low plateaus 

2-fdck - First real disso. Amazing first few times. Then i got slapped with tolerance and i would snort scarface piles for a little buzz.

Dmxe - *lemme be an annoying douchebag rq* I was one of the pioneers with this drug. Less than 5 reports on reddit when i tried. So im pretty much a certified psychonaut. Fr tho this was a pretty great disso. Did a super heavy dose for most people combined with some 2-fdck, and then regrettably snorted around 300mgs more in my hypomanic state. 

3-ho-pcp - i really like but i always underdose myself bc im scared of its potency and my scale is funky.

3-meo-pcp - Cold dissociative mania. I hate being stimulated and dissociating/manic at the same time. It can be very dangerous. Or at least it feels like it.

3-meo-pce - felt very similar to 3-meo-pcp but more confusing and a little more warm.

Ketamine - MY BABY. I searched far and wide for keta. #2 drug of all time. Surprisingly havent fully holed bc of tolerance but ive had tons of fun.

PSYCHEDELICS 🎉🎉- 

Hbwr - nausea and false promises 

Lsd(including rc's) - possibly the best thing on this planet. So many beautiful experiences. So much bonding with family and friends. Its put me in my place many times, been a teacher to me, been a friend. I LOVE LUCY.

Shrooms - Only actually tripped from shrooms once. Other times were way weaker than expected. Took 3.5 grams of some crazy shit. My first full ego death.

Dmt - another type of beast that doesnt even deserve a simple description on reddit. Craziest drug ive ever touched. Still haven't broken through.

4-ho-met - not really tripping, just seeing cool shit for a few hours. Still pretty damn dope.

DELIRIANTS(we've all been at this point at sometime in our youth *cringes intensely*) -

Dph - ass

Dramamine - Somehow worse than dph. And snorting it is an amazing roa for nosebleeds.

Remeron - Not something i want to revisit, but it was one of the most mindfucky drugs ive ever had. The internal hallucinations were so crazy. It doesn't even seem possible that your mind can make them. Purely just plots, sceneries, delirium, and immobilization. 

OTHERS - 

Phenibut - tried killing myself on this, valium, and hydrocodone towards the end of a long binge in a bad point in my life.

Hand sanitizer - huffed it once when i was 13, puked and shit all over myself. Drank it when i was desperate in my treatment center. 

Space monkeys - (making yourself pass out by hyperventilating and blowing on your thumb) hard to do successfully and makes you ashamed of yourself. Again i did this in my treatment center. 

Seroquel - made me tired

SUMMARY - I'm off a lot of 2-fma rn so this has been fun. I've heard all the comments: ""you're gonna end up dead before you turn 18"", ""STOP"", ""you're ruining your life"", etc. I feel like there are gonna be a few but you're preaching to the choir. Im not very proud of my drug abuse despite my fondness of them. Im a huge hypocrite. Ive done fucked up things in my life, ive traumatized people, ive had so many people tell me I'm worthless, Ive been in grief, ive been a fucking terrible person. 
 
Im at a point where drugs have lost their appeal. Ive burnt myself out so young. As odd as it is to say my life has never been better. I have a fantastic job, great relationships with my family again, im still working on finishing high school online. I don't know what to do regarding my drug use. Stopping them is not in my nature. No matter how much transformation i go through, or how long i stay sober for i always come right back. This is just me letting everything out. Any feedback/advice is welcome of course. Thanks for all you who read this all the way through.

<p>Hand sanitizer - huffed it once when i was 13, puked and shit all over myself. Drank it when i was desperate in my treatment center. </p>

<p>Space monkeys - (making yourself pass out by hyperventilating and blowing on your thumb) hard to do successfully and makes you ashamed of yourself. Again i did this in my treatment center. </p>

<p>Seroquel - made me tired</p>

<p>SUMMARY - I&#39;m off a lot of 2-fma rn so this has been fun. I&#39;ve heard all the comments: &quot;you&#39;re gonna end up dead before you turn 18&quot;, &quot;STOP&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re ruining your life&quot;, etc. I feel like there are gonna be a few but you&#39;re preaching to the choir. Im not very proud of my drug abuse despite my fondness of them. Im a huge hypocrite. Ive done fucked up things in my life, ive traumatized people, ive had so many people tell me I&#39;m worthless, Ive been in grief, ive been a fucking terrible person. </p>

<p>Im at a point where drugs have lost their appeal. Ive burnt myself out so young. As odd as it is to say my life has never been better. I have a fantastic job, great relationships with my family again, im still working on finishing high school online. I don&#39;t know what to do regarding my drug use. Stopping them is not in my nature. No matter how much transformation i go through, or how long i stay sober for i always come right back. This is just me letting everything out. Any feedback/advice is welcome of course. Thanks for all you who read this all the way through. Yall are real ones.</p>

190,lrqrg7,georgeyellow,i took CBD and am higher than i have ever been from anything?!,"and that’s a lot of things. i am a seasoned weed smoker and drug enthusiast — i have been many types of high, many different times. but today i was in for an experience that would trump all other highs in its level of bizarreness; it has been so bizarre i don’t even have the words to describe it.

the other day i received some CBD oil from a pal. i had tried it when i was younger and didn’t really react in any way, which i expected, considering its non-psychoactive...

except for today it was definitely psycho-something. i, uninformed and uninspired, decided to try a tincture full of CBD oil. that’s what the bottle said, but it also said to try not to swallow it, just let it dissolve. and to be careful, because cbd has, in a few cases, converted to THC if it goes directly to the stomach. 

i did not see that warning until after i swallowed the entire tincture of CBD. 

and as luck would have it, my stomach is one that does the “converting to THC” thing. 

to say that i’m “high” is a gross understatement. i have never had a stranger, more dissociative, more out of body, more unfamiliar experience. 

earlier it just hit me out of nowhere, and i completely dissociated outside of my body. i was just... outside of it, how do i even explain that?

everything was just not what it should’ve been. it has been incredibly odd. 

at this point i am just curious if anyone else has swallowed an ungodly amount of CBD oil and had similar experiences. i still can neither believe, nor hardly accept, that i am this unironically high from CBD right now.

193,kr1qd4,lowkey_add1ct,All drugs/combos I've tried and my thoughts on them,"Alright, so I've decided to take a break from drugs for a bit, probably a month or so, and I think I need to organize my thoughts for when I go back, so I thought I would share it with the good people of this subreddit. I'm not going to do full ass trip reports or anything just my thoughts and experiences on drugs and combos and what in my subjective opinion is enjoyable/beneficial or negative/harmful. For background on me, I am 19 years old, male, about 6 foot and 160 pounds. I also have adhd and am prescribed Adderall.

DPH: Diphenhydramine, or benadryl. First drug I ever actually tried, and by far the worst shit out there. Hellish, the hallucinations are dark asf, I always felt panicky. The body high is pretty uncomfortable, and the weird nausea is always there, even though you can't throw up or anything. I've tried this shit up to 600 mg, although when I got to 600 mg I more or less blacked out, and I vaguely remember seeing myself being raped by demons, or shadow people. I was definitely psychologically addicted to this for a time, which is stupid asf because its an awful high. 0/10 cannot recommend, there are really no benefits to this drug, extreme dysphoria, its awful. I've only had one or two actual good dph highs, and they were at very low doses, so the negative effects were not as pronounced.

&#x200B;

Weed: I have a love/hate relationship with weed, I probably always will. It has so many benefits, but also has a lot of negatives. when I smoke weed daily, I notice I do not feel depressed, or anxious, but do tend to get paranoid. Anxiety and paranoia feel distinctly different to me, I feel like most people who smoke weed can probably get what I'm saying this. Weed does make me a bit slower with some things, and I tend to feel a bit zoned out or dissociated. Depersonalization is definitely a thing with weed, especially when you smoke daily. By daily, I typically mean hitting a pen once or twice before bed, not being stoned all day. The actual high from weed varies a lot, and when I have a low tolerance there is almost always anxiety. Its very strange because when I feel anxious I want to be sober, or at least feel the same high I do when I have a tolerance, but when I have a tolerance or am sober, I crave that anxious weird tweaky high. The anxiety is usually from the body high, or having to be around people like parents. Weed also has a tendency to make me get stuck in a certain mindset. Typically that mindset is that I love weed and smoking every day is okay. Honestly the biggest way weed has harmed me is in making my addiction to porn worse, which has impacted relationships and things in the past, but that's not really the point of this post. Weed also definitely messes with memory, not just when high but even if its been a few days. Overall, I do still enjoy the weed high, and its one of the safer things I've tried. When I can control myself and don't get addicted to get way too stoned, its one of the more consistently enjoyable highs I get. In addition to what I've mentioned, weed makes me a lot more functional as far ADHD goes and really quiets down the extra ""noise"" which is really helpful. 7/10.

&#x200B;

Caffeine: I used to love caffeine, I mean it was my shit. Everyday, drinking tea all day and playing games or doing schoolwork. I didn't realize at the time how much it was fucking with my sleep and my anxiety, and recently I've noticed that its pretty bad for my ADHD symptoms. It's possible that the reason caffeine messes with me so much now is because of how many times I've tripped on LSD, but regardless, I don't enjoy it, and it's only had negative effects on me recently. The biggest positive to caffeine honestly is its really good at sobering you up after you smoke, and can help a little after an acid trip if you didn't sleep at all.

&#x200B;

LSD: This drug used to be my favorite thing in the fucking world, which was probably part of the problem. I still think LSD is a great drug, and has a potential for benefit, but there's a lot of potential for harm that I initially ignored. I remember the first time I tried LSD, the vibrant visuals, time slowing slightly, the rush of thoughts that felt so comfortable and euphoric at the time. LSD has helped me a great deal as far as breaking bad habits and addictions, and in coming to terms with more personal things. I honestly enjoy this drug a lot more from a recreational aspect, although I've noticed some tabs are different than others visually. To be fair, not every tab I've ever tried has been tested, and I'm sure some of it isn't lsd, but based on the lack of taste I know it wasn't 25i. Regardless, the high that I enjoy most is the bright, visual high that I haven't really gotten as much lately, but what's more beneficial is probably tripping and having some serious introspection. I enjoy the music euphoria a lot too, which is something I tend to look for in drugs. I can say that LSD has changed my life for the better, and helped me come to terms with many things. Some trips have been a lot worse though, and there I was a point where I was using almost weekly, in very low doses. Some of these trips I mostly just felt anxious, but that was largely due to me being stupid, and I don't think that is an accurate view of the substance. When LSD is used with proper breaks, and I don't let it become the only thing I look forward to in life, it's one of the best substances out there. 8/10

&#x200B;

MDMA: My opinion on this one might be different than a lot of other people, and I'm fully aware of the dangers associated with MDMA, but my experiences have been almost entirely positive. the first time I used MDMA, it was an extremely low dose, but was still very beneficial and fun for me. It helped me come to terms with the death of my friend, and I felt a peace about things that I had never really felt before. In higher doses, it can definitely be a little much on my heart and I get nauseous on the comeup, but when I peak fuck its worth it. Definitely one of the most euphoric things I've tried, and the music euphoria is great. I've always waited at least three months in between rolls, usually a lot more, so I haven't really had a bad comedown yet. 9/10

&#x200B;

MDMA+weed: I don't have much to say on this that I didn't cover in the MDMA bit, but weed definitely increases the high, and makes it a bit more trippy and less hard on the heart. It helps a lot with nausea, which is really the only thing I don't like about MDMA, and it gets you way higher. 9/10

&#x200B;

Cocaine: I've only tried this twice, so I don't have a lot of experience. The euphoria is definitely nice, but its such a short lived high and because of the price and its never pure its not really worth it. 4/10

&#x200B;

Shrooms: very mixed experiences with this drug, some being amazing and some being nausea and pretty uncomfortable overall. Some trips I've had have literally just been me drinking water and trying to get through the nausea, and others have been visual asf and very euphoric. The trip that stands out to me the most is when I did 8 grams with a friend, he got in trouble with his parents and I had to go home (I didn't drive). Before I went home, I was really panicking, but after I got into bed with some music I was enjoying myself, had some nice visuals and ended up drifting off to sleep. I would like to try mushrooms again, especially because the visuals have been more consistent on the trips that have been good. 6/10, but I would like to revisit.

&#x200B;

Ketamine: So far this is my favorite drug I've tried, excluding combos. Only tried it once, and it wasn't a crazy dose. I'm not sure the exact dose, but it was nice asf. I had some chill visuals, really creative thinking, and subtle euphoria. It wasn't anything over the top or crazy, and there wasn't any anxiety or uncomfortable body high. My body felt really warm and comfortable actually, and I had an out of body experience towards the end of the high. the music euphoria wasn't as intense as other drugs, and I actually didn't enjoy most of the music I usually do, but I did really enjoy burial. I can't put my finger on exactly what I like about ketamine, it wasn't intense or euphoric or anything, but its fucking amazing. 9/10.

&#x200B;

2CB: one of the more recent things I've tried. I've heard people describe it as feeling between lsd and molly, and I really can't agree. I see how that description makes sense at low doses, like 10-15 mg, but that's about it. I haven't tried 2cb many times, but its not my favorite substance so far. It feels very robotic and has a very weird body high. The body high can definitely be euphoric at times, but the visuals are disappointing in my opinion. Not very vibrant, more like very subtle shapes and things, barely visible. throwing up from the drip is also not a fun experience, and its the worst drip I've ever experienced. 6/10

&#x200B;

2CB+weed: Some craaaaazy shit. The first time I tried 2CB, I snorted about 20-25 mg, which I know is too much for the first time, and I wasn't really enjoying it until I smoked. the body high was intense asf, but unlike tripping on lsd I didn't have to pee often, so I could just lay in bed. Time was slowed down a lot, and the audio almost sounded like pitched down or something. The weed high helped to bring out the visuals, and fractals basically took up my entire vision. The muddy visuals of the weed high actually helped the 2CB visuals a lot, which I was not expected, but I liked a lot. I was pretty paranoid though, and I remember the auditory hallucinations being pretty intense and unwelcome. the next day I also had some hallucinations, like colors shifting and things, which kinda freaked me out. It was very intense, and since I have combined these drugs at lower doses and I have found that they complement each other well, although I would only do this once in a while because of the intensity it can sometimes bring. 6.5/10

&#x200B;

DXM: The weirdest drug I've ever tried. The memory loss during the high can be a bit strange, and it almost feels like a dream sometimes. I've tried poli and hbr, in gelcaps and liquid. The visuals on dxm are interesting, but mild, and I'm not entirely sure how to describe them. The best explanation I can give is its similar to being in a dream, but that's not really accurate either. The nausea really sucks for me, and I've thrown up twice on it, but the dissociation from your body makes the nausea and throwing up less unpleasant than it otherwise would be. This drug is also not very consistent, and it feels like a different drug every time I revisit it. I think it really shines in its combinations with other drugs, but is an experience on its own. DXM also doesn't really cause much anxiety, and I enjoy the anxiolytic effects. 7.5/10

&#x200B;

DXM+weed:  this might be my DOC. Nothing is better, except maybe candyflipping, for music euphoria, and general euphoria. Usually a low dose of dxm, like half a bottle of robocough, and some hits from a pen are good enough for me. Its a very chill feeling, and I usually listen to lo fi or some kind of electronic music and kinda just let it do its thing. The substances are highly synergistic, and this is probably my favorite combo I've tried. The weed helps a lot with the nausea, and the visuals really strengthen each other. I've tried doses up to around 450 with weed, which I think was close to the ""eiffel tower"" dose for me at the time (right in between 2nd and 3rd plat), and was very enjoyable. The only real negative to this combo for me is the loss of memory, but when you keep the doses lower, this effect is not as pronounced. 10/10

&#x200B;

LSD+MDMA: Candyflipping, can be crazy euphoric. Basically drop LSD, wait about 4 hours, then drop MDMA. I've done it twice. First time was fucking amazing. When the mdma kicked in, I did feel really panicky and my heartbeat was through the roof. I was also really dehydrated, really fast, and I had throw up. after throwing up, it was the most euphoric experience I've ever had. I will definitely try this again some day. I felt so fucking warm, and loving, more than I had ever felt before. I had really bad lockjaw the entire time, but even that felt euphoric. I remember rubbing my legs together and basically writhing under the sheets because every physical sensation felt so fucking good. The second time I tried this, I couldn't make myself throw up, and I basically felt stuck, like I couldn't let the euphoria break through, but I think I was kind of resisting it. To enjoy this combo, I think you need to accept throwing up, and you need to be aware of how bad the dehydration is going to be and prepare for it. Regardless, due to the euphoria I've gotta say this is the best feeling in the world, I would say its my DOC, but because of its intensity I don't want to do it too often. Regardless, its the fucking best feeling in the world. 10/10

&#x200B;

Oxycodone: I've done oxy a handful of times, and I've loved pretty much every high. Just straight euphoria and relaxation, no anxiety. I tend to like drugs that kill all anxiety, which is why I like dxm so much. I definitely need higher doses to feel serious euphoria like I did the first time, even though its only been a few times I've tried it. It hasn't really effected me negatively because I've always spaced out my high to avoid addiction, but there's obviously a severe addiction risk with any opioid and I definitely can see how people get addicted to it. Still, I enjoy it, and for me personally it hasn't really had a negative effect on my life. 8.5/10

&#x200B;

Oxy+Weed: I don't have much to add here, but weed and oxy changes the high to be more of a body high, and is an interesting experience. I don't feel the same euphoria so I would recommend smoking after the peak, but it is an enjoyable experience in its own right. 7.5/10

&#x200B;

Hydrocodone: I've only done this twice, once with pills once with syrup. Syrup mostly just made me tired and relaxed, no real euphoria, and pills made me feel like really fucked up, but not really euphoric. A similar feeling to when you get too stoned or something. I couldn't really think straight and since it wasn't that euphoric I can't say it was really worth it. 4/10

&#x200B;

LSD+oxy+weed: I heard people talk about the neon nod and thought it would be fun to try, but fuck no, I hated that shit. I couldn't really think straight and basically lost all control over my body. I had to sit up to try and get my shit together, and I kept falling over onto my bed. The acid made me want to keep moving and doing shit and the oxy made it almost impossible to do, so it sucked. I felt like shit the next day too, can't recommend at all. 0/10

&#x200B;

Vyvanse: I fuck with vyvanse, but only to get high. I was prescribed it and fuck that shit did not work for me. I used to take 50s and I enjoyed the high, especially smoking on the comedown. When I was prescribed them I would have depressive episodes and shit, got taken off that shit fast asf, but its a cool high. I don't feel a lot of anxiety from it, and there's a lot of energy with it. Definitely increases ego, I felt powerful asf, confident asf. 7.5/10.

&#x200B;

Adderall: Prescribed it for a while now, and it works pretty well for my adhd, but getting high on it is fun too. Its not very consistent anymore probably because I have tolerance but it can be quite euphoric. I don't stimmed out on addy every time, usually its just a chill feeling, kinda zombie like. Still a fun drug, even though the comedowns are godawful. Smoking weed after is a lot of fun too. 7.5/10

&#x200B;

LSD+Shrooms: I've only done this once, so its probably not the best view of the drug, but I had some of the coolest visuals I've ever had while coming up. I saw pirate ships, and alien landscapes, and all sorts of 3d immersive visuals, which I rarely get. The trip eventually took a turn for the worse though, and I became very anxious. I remember seeing jungle people, and I felt them stab me with spears. My body felt very strange, and my skin felt leathery, like that of some strange animal. The beginning was the coolest psychedelic experience I've had so far, but it turned bad quickly. I will need to try again with lower doses. I think the doses I took were around 200-300ug and 2.5-3.5 grams of mushrooms.

&#x200B;

LSD+2CB: again, this is something I've only done once, but I still wanted to touch on it. This is one of the few daytrips I've had, and it was a mixed experience. I was in the woods, and got a bit panicky because I couldn't recognize my surroundings. I ended up going back to my car and chilling there. I felt better, but still really panicky for a little while. I took 1.5 tabs and 10-15 mg of 2CB, which was more than enough. When this anxious feeling left, I had some of the coolest visuals I've ever had. I remember looking at the persons face who I was with. Her face looked very different, its hard to explain how, but almost minimalist or something, but I could also see some sort of writing or glyphs on her face, which looks kinda like aztec visuals I've had before. The trip was okay after that until I smoked, which led to me being unable to walk, while in the mountains. I was convinced I was going to die, which had never happened to me before, and scared the shit out of me. I don't want to make this post too long so but that's the basics of it.

&#x200B;

LSD+weed: before the acid hits, smoking subdues the visuals and the high a lot in my experience, and I can't recommend it. Smoking after the peak is cool if the body high doesn't get too intense, and can lead to some cool visuals. The only 'downside' if you can call it that, is that I sometimes get insanely horny on this combo, to the point where I tend to jerk off way too much. Regardless, this combo can be cool at times, and provides some really cool spacey feelings and euphoria. There is definitely some anxiety and shit associated with it as well. 6.5/10

&#x200B;

Alcohol: The most overrated drug. I've seen it fuck up people's lives so damn easy because its so accessible. I do think that it can be fun, and I've had some surprising euphoria on alcohol alone, but I don't think it compares to most other drugs, and I usually end up feeling really stupid and goofy, without having a lot of fun. There can be some really euphoric moments and it allows you to open up about shit, not as much as on psychedelics, but its still something to consider. 5.5/10

&#x200B;

Kava: One of my favorites. While I wouldn't necessarily call this a 'drug' it is something you ingest that changes how you feel a bit, so it kind of is. Its a very mild feeling, and I would guess its not enough for most people on this sub, but I enjoy it a lot, especially when I'm taking breaks to be sober, like right now. It helps wind me down at the end of the day and helps me sleep, especially when I have to take adderall, and it doesn't really have any negatives besides dehydrating you slightly. It can have some 'euphoria' although I'm hesitant to call it that because its so mild, but I enjoy it nonetheless. 9.5/10

&#x200B;

CBD: Another really mild substance, but during the day if I want to chill and I don't want to smoke, cbd honestly works better for anxiety than thc imo. I never get paranoid or anything, and to be fair I technically don't get high, but if weed is a bit too much or you're looking for something more mild, cbd is the move. 9/10

&#x200B;

Delta-8: This is pretty much the same as weed for me, but has a lot less negatives. I get less paranoid and it works better for anxiety reduction in my subjective opinion. 8/10

&#x200B;

This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought, so thanks to anyone who actually read through everything. I would like to answer any comments on this, so if anyone relates or disagrees I would be interested to hear.",1609863990.0,,Long Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/kr1qd4/all_drugscombos_ive_tried_and_my_thoughts_on_them/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_3u5v8k57,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Long Post'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Custom,0,,,False,t3_kr1qd4,False,dark,0.98,,public,159,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,159,,False,False,self,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Alright, so I&#39;ve decided to take a break from drugs for a bit, probably a month or so, and I think I need to organize my thoughts for when I go back, so I thought I would share it with the good people of this subreddit. I&#39;m not going to do full ass trip reports or anything just my thoughts and experiences on drugs and combos and what in my subjective opinion is enjoyable/beneficial or negative/harmful. For background on me, I am 19 years old, male, about 6 foot and 160 pounds. I also have adhd and am prescribed Adderall.</p>

<p>DPH: Diphenhydramine, or benadryl. First drug I ever actually tried, and by far the worst shit out there. Hellish, the hallucinations are dark asf, I always felt panicky. The body high is pretty uncomfortable, and the weird nausea is always there, even though you can&#39;t throw up or anything. I&#39;ve tried this shit up to 600 mg, although when I got to 600 mg I more or less blacked out, and I vaguely remember seeing myself being raped by demons, or shadow people. I was definitely psychologically addicted to this for a time, which is stupid asf because its an awful high. 0/10 cannot recommend, there are really no benefits to this drug, extreme dysphoria, its awful. I&#39;ve only had one or two actual good dph highs, and they were at very low doses, so the negative effects were not as pronounced.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Weed: I have a love/hate relationship with weed, I probably always will. It has so many benefits, but also has a lot of negatives. when I smoke weed daily, I notice I do not feel depressed, or anxious, but do tend to get paranoid. Anxiety and paranoia feel distinctly different to me, I feel like most people who smoke weed can probably get what I&#39;m saying this. Weed does make me a bit slower with some things, and I tend to feel a bit zoned out or dissociated. Depersonalization is definitely a thing with weed, especially when you smoke daily. By daily, I typically mean hitting a pen once or twice before bed, not being stoned all day. The actual high from weed varies a lot, and when I have a low tolerance there is almost always anxiety. Its very strange because when I feel anxious I want to be sober, or at least feel the same high I do when I have a tolerance, but when I have a tolerance or am sober, I crave that anxious weird tweaky high. The anxiety is usually from the body high, or having to be around people like parents. Weed also has a tendency to make me get stuck in a certain mindset. Typically that mindset is that I love weed and smoking every day is okay. Honestly the biggest way weed has harmed me is in making my addiction to porn worse, which has impacted relationships and things in the past, but that&#39;s not really the point of this post. Weed also definitely messes with memory, not just when high but even if its been a few days. Overall, I do still enjoy the weed high, and its one of the safer things I&#39;ve tried. When I can control myself and don&#39;t get addicted to get way too stoned, its one of the more consistently enjoyable highs I get. In addition to what I&#39;ve mentioned, weed makes me a lot more functional as far ADHD goes and really quiets down the extra &quot;noise&quot; which is really helpful. 7/10.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Caffeine: I used to love caffeine, I mean it was my shit. Everyday, drinking tea all day and playing games or doing schoolwork. I didn&#39;t realize at the time how much it was fucking with my sleep and my anxiety, and recently I&#39;ve noticed that its pretty bad for my ADHD symptoms. It&#39;s possible that the reason caffeine messes with me so much now is because of how many times I&#39;ve tripped on LSD, but regardless, I don&#39;t enjoy it, and it&#39;s only had negative effects on me recently. The biggest positive to caffeine honestly is its really good at sobering you up after you smoke, and can help a little after an acid trip if you didn&#39;t sleep at all.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>LSD: This drug used to be my favorite thing in the fucking world, which was probably part of the problem. I still think LSD is a great drug, and has a potential for benefit, but there&#39;s a lot of potential for harm that I initially ignored. I remember the first time I tried LSD, the vibrant visuals, time slowing slightly, the rush of thoughts that felt so comfortable and euphoric at the time. LSD has helped me a great deal as far as breaking bad habits and addictions, and in coming to terms with more personal things. I honestly enjoy this drug a lot more from a recreational aspect, although I&#39;ve noticed some tabs are different than others visually. To be fair, not every tab I&#39;ve ever tried has been tested, and I&#39;m sure some of it isn&#39;t lsd, but based on the lack of taste I know it wasn&#39;t 25i. Regardless, the high that I enjoy most is the bright, visual high that I haven&#39;t really gotten as much lately, but what&#39;s more beneficial is probably tripping and having some serious introspection. I enjoy the music euphoria a lot too, which is something I tend to look for in drugs. I can say that LSD has changed my life for the better, and helped me come to terms with many things. Some trips have been a lot worse though, and there I was a point where I was using almost weekly, in very low doses. Some of these trips I mostly just felt anxious, but that was largely due to me being stupid, and I don&#39;t think that is an accurate view of the substance. When LSD is used with proper breaks, and I don&#39;t let it become the only thing I look forward to in life, it&#39;s one of the best substances out there. 8/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>MDMA: My opinion on this one might be different than a lot of other people, and I&#39;m fully aware of the dangers associated with MDMA, but my experiences have been almost entirely positive. the first time I used MDMA, it was an extremely low dose, but was still very beneficial and fun for me. It helped me come to terms with the death of my friend, and I felt a peace about things that I had never really felt before. In higher doses, it can definitely be a little much on my heart and I get nauseous on the comeup, but when I peak fuck its worth it. Definitely one of the most euphoric things I&#39;ve tried, and the music euphoria is great. I&#39;ve always waited at least three months in between rolls, usually a lot more, so I haven&#39;t really had a bad comedown yet. 9/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>MDMA+weed: I don&#39;t have much to say on this that I didn&#39;t cover in the MDMA bit, but weed definitely increases the high, and makes it a bit more trippy and less hard on the heart. It helps a lot with nausea, which is really the only thing I don&#39;t like about MDMA, and it gets you way higher. 9/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Cocaine: I&#39;ve only tried this twice, so I don&#39;t have a lot of experience. The euphoria is definitely nice, but its such a short lived high and because of the price and its never pure its not really worth it. 4/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Shrooms: very mixed experiences with this drug, some being amazing and some being nausea and pretty uncomfortable overall. Some trips I&#39;ve had have literally just been me drinking water and trying to get through the nausea, and others have been visual asf and very euphoric. The trip that stands out to me the most is when I did 8 grams with a friend, he got in trouble with his parents and I had to go home (I didn&#39;t drive). Before I went home, I was really panicking, but after I got into bed with some music I was enjoying myself, had some nice visuals and ended up drifting off to sleep. I would like to try mushrooms again, especially because the visuals have been more consistent on the trips that have been good. 6/10, but I would like to revisit.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Ketamine: So far this is my favorite drug I&#39;ve tried, excluding combos. Only tried it once, and it wasn&#39;t a crazy dose. I&#39;m not sure the exact dose, but it was nice asf. I had some chill visuals, really creative thinking, and subtle euphoria. It wasn&#39;t anything over the top or crazy, and there wasn&#39;t any anxiety or uncomfortable body high. My body felt really warm and comfortable actually, and I had an out of body experience towards the end of the high. the music euphoria wasn&#39;t as intense as other drugs, and I actually didn&#39;t enjoy most of the music I usually do, but I did really enjoy burial. I can&#39;t put my finger on exactly what I like about ketamine, it wasn&#39;t intense or euphoric or anything, but its fucking amazing. 9/10.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>2CB: one of the more recent things I&#39;ve tried. I&#39;ve heard people describe it as feeling between lsd and molly, and I really can&#39;t agree. I see how that description makes sense at low doses, like 10-15 mg, but that&#39;s about it. I haven&#39;t tried 2cb many times, but its not my favorite substance so far. It feels very robotic and has a very weird body high. The body high can definitely be euphoric at times, but the visuals are disappointing in my opinion. Not very vibrant, more like very subtle shapes and things, barely visible. throwing up from the drip is also not a fun experience, and its the worst drip I&#39;ve ever experienced. 6/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>2CB+weed: Some craaaaazy shit. The first time I tried 2CB, I snorted about 20-25 mg, which I know is too much for the first time, and I wasn&#39;t really enjoying it until I smoked. the body high was intense asf, but unlike tripping on lsd I didn&#39;t have to pee often, so I could just lay in bed. Time was slowed down a lot, and the audio almost sounded like pitched down or something. The weed high helped to bring out the visuals, and fractals basically took up my entire vision. The muddy visuals of the weed high actually helped the 2CB visuals a lot, which I was not expected, but I liked a lot. I was pretty paranoid though, and I remember the auditory hallucinations being pretty intense and unwelcome. the next day I also had some hallucinations, like colors shifting and things, which kinda freaked me out. It was very intense, and since I have combined these drugs at lower doses and I have found that they complement each other well, although I would only do this once in a while because of the intensity it can sometimes bring. 6.5/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>DXM: The weirdest drug I&#39;ve ever tried. The memory loss during the high can be a bit strange, and it almost feels like a dream sometimes. I&#39;ve tried poli and hbr, in gelcaps and liquid. The visuals on dxm are interesting, but mild, and I&#39;m not entirely sure how to describe them. The best explanation I can give is its similar to being in a dream, but that&#39;s not really accurate either. The nausea really sucks for me, and I&#39;ve thrown up twice on it, but the dissociation from your body makes the nausea and throwing up less unpleasant than it otherwise would be. This drug is also not very consistent, and it feels like a different drug every time I revisit it. I think it really shines in its combinations with other drugs, but is an experience on its own. DXM also doesn&#39;t really cause much anxiety, and I enjoy the anxiolytic effects. 7.5/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>DXM+weed:  this might be my DOC. Nothing is better, except maybe candyflipping, for music euphoria, and general euphoria. Usually a low dose of dxm, like half a bottle of robocough, and some hits from a pen are good enough for me. Its a very chill feeling, and I usually listen to lo fi or some kind of electronic music and kinda just let it do its thing. The substances are highly synergistic, and this is probably my favorite combo I&#39;ve tried. The weed helps a lot with the nausea, and the visuals really strengthen each other. I&#39;ve tried doses up to around 450 with weed, which I think was close to the &quot;eiffel tower&quot; dose for me at the time (right in between 2nd and 3rd plat), and was very enjoyable. The only real negative to this combo for me is the loss of memory, but when you keep the doses lower, this effect is not as pronounced. 10/10</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>LSD+MDMA: Candyflipping, can be crazy euphoric. Basically drop LSD, wait about 4 hours, then drop MDMA. I&#39;ve done it twice. First time was fucking amazing. When the mdma kicked in, I did feel really panicky and my heartbeat was through the roof. I was also really dehydrated, really fast, and I had throw up. after throwing up, it was the most euphoric experience I&#39;ve ever had. I will definitely try this again some day. I felt so fucking warm, and loving, more than I had ever felt before. I had really bad lockjaw the entire time, but even that felt euphoric. I remember rubbing my legs together and basically writhing under the sheets because every physical sensation felt so fucking good. The second time I tried this, I couldn&#39;t make myself throw up, and I basically felt stuck, like I couldn&#39;t let the euphoria break through, but I think I was kind of resisting it. To enjoy this combo, I think you need to accept throwing up, and you need to be aware of how bad the dehydration is going to be and prepare for it. Regardless, due to the euphoria I&#39;ve gotta say this is the best feeling in the world, I would say its my DOC, but because of its intensity I don&#39;t want to do it too often. Regardless, its the fucking best feeling in the world. 10/10</p>

<p>Oxycodone: I&#39;ve done oxy a handful of times, and I&#39;ve loved pretty much every high. Just straight euphoria and relaxation, no anxiety.

I couldn&#39;t really think straight and basically lost all control over my body. I had to sit up to try and get my shit together, and I kept falling over onto my bed. The acid made me want to keep moving and doing shit and the oxy made it almost impossible to do, so it sucked. I felt like shit the next day too, can&#39;t recommend at all. 0/10</p>

200,piiy1j,bk_998325,An interesting and weird combo.,"So, I'm on a plane. Bored as fuck. Here is some useless info exiting my brain into yours. Zap.

I just remembered an utterly random experience I had a few weeks ago.

Been experimenting with what's available legally for a change.

I had taken a bunch of kratom earlier that day. Impulsively snorted noopept (about 30 mgs) because, well, why the hell not?

I had been hitting on a delta 8 pen for a while, went on a walk, and felt really nice.

Weirdly enough, a cbd joint I smoked about a half hour after going out changed everything (second time cbd has interacted for me with kratom so I'm starting to think this is a thing with my brain chemistry).

Immediately after smoking a few hits of it, COLOR and LIGHT attacked me. At least that's what it felt like. Each color became more intense and the light was blinding. It was beautiful and anxiety inducing. Only way I can describe it.

Seems like snorting noopept (30mg or more for me) plus CBD flower (for me cbd flower seems to fuck me up WAY more than just thc) can enhance color beautifully. I guess the kratom was too much for me to add to the mix.

Anyway, that concludes my randomness. I refuse to proofread this right now, so if I said anything that doesn't make sense, or if you have any questions, drop a comment :)",1630868165.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/piiy1j/an_interesting_and_weird_combo/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_9p2hzbza,False,,0,False,[],r/Drugs,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_piiy1j,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,text,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So, I&#39;m on a plane.

202,mbi5h8,CabinetOfOpium,"It seems like my reaction to weed vs edibles, Delta-9 vs 11-Hydroxy THC, is opposite to most.","Most people I know will gladly take a few pulls of a joint or share a blunt anytime, doing most anything! Edible, though? ""Uh, I don't know, man, I think I have work tomorrow, and how strong is that anyways? I don't want to freak out..."". I have an odd reaction to eating vs smoking weed.

For a quick example; last week I was reading about the Marylin Manson accusations, got deep into it and was just like ""FUCK, that is TOUGH...."" and decided to pack a lil bowl, CBD on bottom, hash in middle, bud on top. Proceed to milk bowl, and....there I am, deer in the headlights. Thinking over and over how hard the world can be, how bad it is that people can do such bad things to each other. This period of panic, no doubt helped by the morbid mind-material, lasts about 15m regardless of what's in my head, if the smoke hits me wrong. I panic for 15 minutes and cool down, that's just how it went when I started the morning with a fat bowl.

Funny thing is? After that first puff or drag of weed and the first 15m panic, I'm good. I can smoke 5 more bowls of the same potency back to back to back, which explains why my bowls are packed with strong hashish and stuff, smoking is just more unpredictable for me. I don't know for sure that I'll feel good or relaxed after.

Edibles, however, especially in a dose between 100-500mg? Oh, that's me. That's an every-time, instant panic cure for me, or insomnia cure, or just a feel-good substance. I went through nearly a gram and a half of straight THC just these past 3 days. 11-HO-THC, as opposed to the smoked Delta-9 THC, is 3x stronger, longer lasting, and more psychedelic. I NEVER ever trip off of them, it acts like a benzo for me, practically. Better than Valium, honestly. 

This is a phenomenon that has been happening for years with me, but for a little backstory, I am inclined towards relaxing substances as I'm a naturally anxious person. Due to this, I used to have an affinity for things like benzos, heavy opioids, and alcohol, but I've had to put those things down. When I did, I already smoked major weed/wax (quit wax, only smoke hash now, but strong hash, 50+%) but I used it even more to compensate, and have since. It's a great relaxant without being an actual sedative and I would recommend a 300mg dose to anyone who wants to stop using heavy downers like alcohol, benzos, opioids, GABAergics, Soma, whatever. Like, right now, I'd be a little hesitant to just spark up and smoke this whole joint to the dome, but I have a box of 50x20mg THC tablets, and I'd take them all without hesitation this moment if someone reimbursed me the cost.",1616515786.0,,Cannabis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/mbi5h8/it_seems_like_my_reaction_to_weed_vs_edibles/,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f93fc23d340>,,Drugs,t2_8ogm7oco,False,,0,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Cannabis'}]",r/Drugs,False,0,Cannabinoids,0,,,False,t3_mbi5h8,False,dark,0.56,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,1,,False,False,self,1616515998.0,,[],{},,True,,richtext,0,,,text,self.Drugs,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Most people I know will gladly take a few pulls of a joint or share a blunt anytime, doing most anything!

205,nr12al,Ser_Sandor_Clegane,Psychedlic experience on weed,"About all of yesterday, I had a nice buzz going with some Delta 8 THC tincture, but around 12 am I went for what is a heroic dose for me 

I usually take about 20-30 mg, and I enjoy the high a lot, but this time I went for a little over 60 mg this time

I was packed with energy, but also chilling, just talking to my girl and some friends

Though I noticed I got all the usual philosophical thoughts that I usually get when I take LSD. What my existence means, death, my connection to every other human as a human being, some sense of collective consciousness

I decided to get a binaural beat, lay down, and cover my eyes

I set a timer for 30 minutes and dove in

Let me tell you, I saw more fractals and shapes than I ever have my several times tripping on LSD

Things began morphing into other things, I would see extremely detailed faces, faces made up of fractals, things flowed into the next

I watched trees and wood turn to liquid, I saw landscapes, I felt all of humanity inside of my chest, a warmth. I felt a kinship to every human

I decided to focus on the area above my head, and on my forehead rather than thinking about earthly things 

What I saw slowly morphed into the fractals again. A kaleidoscope, a million different colors and shapes in perfect symmetry. They were seriously bright and vivid

I saw people and places I can't describe the image of

These entities made up of a million shining little mirrors that morphed in and out of each other

I felt like I was floating upwards, my body become cold then I ceased to feel my body at all

My timer eventually went off, but there seems to be some kind of image stuck in my head. During my meditation, I saw the face of some... man, I assume? He had a round face, orange, smooth skin, and one eye directly between where human eyes would be

His teeth were jagged and stuck out of his mouth, they were sharp

my mom obviously found out since her bottle was basically empty (it is empty now) and i felt guilty-ish in the moment and i apologized and she was actually really nice about it. (idk what the hell would happen if my dad found out tho) i dont regret it though i do kinda want it again. drugs are expensive though and ppl call u gross for doing them so lets not. i didnt stop stop for my own self i stopped cause i feel like i dont have a choice and ill be honest. its really something how i went against my own morals, i always said i wouldnt do drugs and i kinda found kids my age who i tried substances cringey but now its full circle. (not talking about kids with full on addictions but i do believe the kids that do that stuff in even social settings can be using it as self destruction) i tried tianeptine, 4f-mph, phenibut, nicotine (smoking is still something i get embarrassment from so idk why i even tried it, i tried delta 8 and then ended up blacking out which is really funny because some 4f-mph didnt do anything but some thc knocked me on my ass.

207,hwpnl5,psychotic_corpse_,OPINION: Kratom is an opioid that can be compared to others,"The r/kratom community forbids mentioning comparisons between kratom and “real opioids.” While it is true that kratom produces different effects than traditional opioids, such as slight antagonism of glutamate receptors (NMDA) and action on serotonin and norepinephrine in addition to mu- and delta-opioid agonism, just like morphine and oxycodone. I’m tired of people overstating the benefits of kratom and suppressing those within the kratom-using community that aren’t part of the kratom cult. I cannot publish a report there of kratom’s interesting pharmacology or conduct an assay in myself and publish it. 

If I cannot make comparisons to other drugs, how would an opioid user struggling to get clean know that kratom is a better alternative for many than suboxone or methadone? In a world where kratom isn’t as widely accepted for this reason that is.

211,n97m1x,I-Pessimist,Former/rare smoker - upcoming hair test,"Hello!

Pretty self-explanatory title. 

Quit smoking regularly almost two years ago. Usually just dabble in CBD now. I have an upcoming hair test in 3 weeks.

I’ve only smoked about once a month in the last 2+ months. 

-one of which being 2 puffs of a pen (6 weeks ago)

- dry ripped an old bowl that I found in the garage doing spring cleaning (2 months ago)

- shared a CBD/hemp pre-roll with a buddy 2 weeks ago (supposedly less than .3% delta 8/9)

My hair is pretty short. Basically shaved on the sides and less than 2 inches styled on the top. 

TLDR: is it worth it to go into heavy detoxing or should my infrequent usage suffice?

212,n5zx6v,Responsible-Chair168,My high Speedball Thoughts.. *LONG POST/rANT*,"* I'm 27 been to rehab multiple times, ive noticed if you dont want to really fix your life you never will, rehabs are just centers for junkies to go get clean, talk all day bout drugs and how to get better high's and even sneak drugs in into the rehab to pass the time there, once my roonmate told me he's been there more than 25 times cause its like a vacation, also the staff only wants to pass the time and take out there frustation on the patients if they in bad moods, they brainwash you to think that yo are hopeless, sick person thats not capable of living alone and is a highrisk of suicide to be able to manipulate your family into thinkin you can die anyday and ill never stop, which im proud to say ive been off the Needle for half a year or more, also they drug you up to keep you in the loop, and f\*cked up on antipsychotics and worse things, like me they got me hooked on suboxone that ive been tryin to get off for month's .. and its been hell if anyone got any tips on natural pain killers i would appriciate it ,  been takin delta 8, cbd, 1mg xanax bars if my anxiety flairs up bad and smoking a lot of buds..also not gonna lie i take a few Endo's 608 or 512's when i'm in physical pain.. I'm not abusing like when i was 18 until 26, i was I'ving Cocaine, Fent, H and at my worst i was smoking crack, 1 Month from snorting fent for the fist time i ended up using a needle in a matter of Month's i really dont Recomend it, its a horrible drug, everyone think they can control the dosage's but the streets are only interested in the money, not your wellbeing always remember that! Even a ""Friend"" sold me 3 fake m 30's oxys and they were fent, i OD'e and woke up infront of my home with paramedic's cause those so called Friends threw me infront of my home and i even had a bump in my forehead from the CURB, they aint living in the Same Island im living in anymore, they had to move...cause i wasnt the only one who OD'ed luckily my parents were home..Such an ugly scene for them i felt so sorry for my mom that made me change a lot of decisions..
* &#x200B;

 Also Noticed that Life is all about BALANCE..if you aint pissed off all the time, if you keep your dosage's low and dont let your ego get too boosted and start drawing attention to yourself, keep eyedrops, dont do drugs in places that there might be a slight chance you may get caught, like a friend of mine got arrested cause we were smoking in a park, sh\*t was there was a school a few blocks away, thats what f\*cked him up, straight A student, another dude had a stolen gun stashed in my friend's car, didnt say it was his so my friend went from being accepted to Yale, to Jail...

&#x200B;

 So yeah all my rambling is like a friendly Junkie reminder, to always be aware of your surrounding, your dosages, you can always take small doses an go up but you can never go down if you do to much, also keep your family's emotions in mind, my mom and father have suffered so much mentaly that it hurts my just to think about it, cause they are human and they can also crack under the pressure..ive always been autodesctructive when i got mad or things didnt go my way, what has helped me alot these days is thinking differently, i know it sounds stupid like i know its complex, but check out what

paradigms are and see if you can adjust and tweak \*lol\* your habits, so you can feel better about yourself by adjusting, also the diet is really importante..

LAST THING IS i recommend that you should keep your private life to yourself cause when you admit too much of what drugs and things your doing, anyone can use that against you even in court if you text and you cant take back the shit that comes out of that mouth when you mad or frustatedd..

214,nl3i33,Robojuana254,Trauma rant about my son and being poor.,"My son is special needs. Born at 23 weeks, he suffered from hydrocephalus for 8 months before he was healthy enough for a shunt. We were told repeatedly that he wouldn’t live and as ignorant as we were, we knew that he just needed more time. 13 months after his birth he was released from the hospital. I used poppy seed tea the entire time; it was how I coped with the idea of losing my son. He will be 5 this year and we are once again hospitalized, this time with rhinovirus and para-influenza 3. He got pneumonia one week after he was born and it scarred his lungs all to shit and that has made him extra vulnerable to any number of things. 

This last hospitalization he coded after he arrived at the hospital due to what I believe was an overdose of albuterol. The hospital didn’t exercise his muscles when he was intubated and now his arms and legs are all stiff. This fucking world is just too much for me sometimes. I’m just forever thankful I was interested in pharmacology as a teenager because that has blossomed into a profound relationship with medicinal plants. I haven’t had decent health care in over a decade and have no faith in my government as a result. I take kratom and delta-8 THC daily as coping mechanisms because no better therapy has been presented to me. Capitalism has crushed my spirit and I long for the opportunity to escape to the countryside and flee the trappings of money worship.

To those who are truly suffering from the intensely horrible negative effects of 25i nbome regardless of intention of ingestion I am sorry and you're not crazy. The depersonalization, the hollowness, the irrational fear, the lack of objective observational skills, the painfully slow-functioning mind are absolutely fucking real. I can fucking attest to that.

If you're in this hell and you're desperate. Or you've waited long enough for it to go away and it hasn't here's what's worked for me.

Microdose psilocybin. 0.2-0.5 grams a trip and up the dose when you feel the time is right. **Do not do this too soon after a 25i nbome experience or you could end up being worse off than when you started. Wait at least a month, minimum 2 weeks post 25i-nbome if you really can't wait that long.** This isn't for pleasure or fucking around. It's medicine to get you better so careful with the doses. A 25i-nbome addled mind that takes too strong a dose of psilocybin I imagine will have more negative consequences than positive. Wait 2 weeks before redosing otherwise you'll build a tolerance and you're just screwing yourself over in the long run.

What you do with this information is on you. I don't know if it'll help but I am telling you that it's helped me.

Godspeed. I anticipate the ""trust me bro it didn't happen to me so 25i is cool"" comments coming. The ones that can't see beyond their subjective lives and can't understand that they could be wrong because said experience wasn't bad for them. Ignore these people. If you're suffering from the effects of 25i-nbome post use in a negative way chances are it's already extremely difficult for you to come to your own conclusions because of the absolute shit state your mind is in and I understand these people with a lack of objective perspective aren't helping.

I've ran into this fucking drug multiple fucking times now. Ehrlichs test will not fucking identify 25i either so heads up on that.

https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/pretty-sure-i-got-an-nbome-but-it-tested-purple-with-ehrlichs-reagent.637070/

This anecdotal experience matches mine. I tested it, it came up positive for LSD but it still also ended up being fucking 25i nbome.

LSD can be a beautiful medicine. To those I anticipate will respond with ""you just had a bad trip. it wasn't 25i you just can't handle your lsd"" the fact that I'm keenly aware of this possible response and mindful enough to predict it I think can measure my cognitive ability to discern between LSD and 25i nbome. **I've never had a bad LSD trip.** LSD is a beautiful medicine that has saved my life time and time again due to the powerful healing effects that can be produced by it. And because of constantly running into 25i nbome in my attempts to heal myself through LSD I don't know if I'll ever risk taking LSD again due to the potential of it being 25i nbome.

This is a warning to those who want to try LSD and are unaware of 25i and a message of healing and hope to those who are suffering from 25i. You can improve and get better. I'm proof of that. I've healed myself through psilocybin, LSD (though for the previously mentioned reasons I wouldn't recommend LSD), microdoses of salvia and changa. Though I'd only recommend psilocybin to begin with as the others are much more powerful and not to be taken lightly. Don't fuck around. Riding the symptoms out by not using anything altogether and staying healthy is of course an option too if that's working for you.

On the basis of the case history, the hospital blood and urine were sent to NMS Labs for NBOMe and psilocin confirmation. The blood was positive for 25I-NBOMe, and the urine was positive for 25C-, 25H- and 25I-NBOMe, as well as, psilocin. Antemortem and postmortem blood were also sent to AIT Laboratories for NBOMe confirmation. The antemortem blood confirmed positive for 25I-NBOMe with a concentration of 0.76 ng/mL.

RIP. Shitty fucks took a substance (LSD) that can have such powerful, beautiful healing effects and created an ecosystem where this drug (25i-nbome) can be sold in place of it. Here's a general **fuck you** to anyone who has supported and continues to support this ecosystem in any way.

editing in why I'm so aggressive in this post:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cjl23a/25i_nbome_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_drug_a/eve69ji/

I'd say it's general acceptable knowledge but I always got the feeling people weren't vehement enough towards 25i. I think the ones who've truly suffered so much from it can't articulate/defend themselves against the responses from people who counter with ""dude it's cool you'll be fine."" And that's probably why I was so aggressive in this post. It's totally cool if you or others do it and benefit/enjoy it I just don't like that it can come at the cost of the people who've suffered and can't quite put into words the true horrors of what it can do due to the true horrors of what's been done to them.

This seems to be a good way to test for 25i as well as LSD. The marquis/mecke will detect for 25i and ehrlichs will test for the indole.

<p><a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cjl23a/25i_nbome_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_drug_a/eve69ji/"">https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cjl23a/25i_nbome_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_drug_a/eve69ji/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s general acceptable knowledge but I always got the feeling people weren&#39;t vehement enough towards 25i. I think the ones who&#39;ve truly suffered so much from it can&#39;t articulate/defend themselves against the responses from people who counter with &quot;dude it&#39;s cool you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; And that&#39;s probably why I was so aggressive in this post. It&#39;s totally cool if you or others do it and benefit/enjoy it I just don&#39;t like that it can come at the cost of the people who&#39;ve suffered and can&#39;t quite put into words the true horrors of what it can do due to the true horrors of what&#39;s been done to them.</p>

<p>editing this in as well</p>

<p><a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cjl23a/25i_nbome_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_drug_a/eves47w/"">https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/cjl23a/25i_nbome_can_be_an_extremely_dangerous_drug_a/eves47w/</a></p>

<p>This seems to be a good way to test for 25i as well as LSD. The marquis/mecke will detect for 25i and ehrlichs will test for the indole. I don&#39;t know why ehrlichs is always recommended in hindsight it makes more sense to test for 25i. This is an important comment and so I&#39;m adding to it to this post</p>

Years ago, I had possibly the best night of my life while under the influence of 1mg alprazolam, 100mg butalbital, and ~20mg oxycodone. Well after years of searching, I've finally gathered these drugs again to go on a Christmas eve hike on a beautiful, cold day.

At 0900 CST, I dropped 2mg alprazolam, 200mg butalbital, and 50mg hydrcodone. At this moment, around 0940, I'm feeling the come up, most likely spearheaded by the caffeine in the butalbital. The dosages are higher than my previous benzodiazepine/barbiturate/opioid experience but my tolerances to GABA-ergics and opioids have since increased considerably. In both cases, the pills came from pharmacies so there is no risk of pill presses with unknown substances.

My purpose in this post is to report on the effects of this ""holy trinity"" combo. Which I will update periodically over the course of the day. I don't expect full effects until 1100, particularly with the hydrocodone.

Ideally I hope to get a manageable nod that becomes somewhat prominent when sitting and not focusing on something. I suspect the nod will be barely perceptible but it's still early. If I'm dissappointed in the results, I will take some puffs off a Delta-8 THC cart and/or maybe take 50mg of Delta-8 THC edibles.

227,j4t49m,cameron_552,Weed tolerance break/D-8-THC/CBD,"I smoke so much weed that i don’t feel it, at all, anymore. I’m trying to take a tolerance break, but it’s hard. Not getting high isn’t so hard, since i haven’t been high in months thanks to my tolerance, but i find myself really bored without something to perform the ritual of smoking (rolling a blunt, grinding weed and packing a bowl, etc). 

I have a few questions.

1. I’ve been trying to do this tolerance break for a few months. i’ve failed, a lot, and restarted, a lot. So i find it hard to justify not smoking when i end up failing anyway 3 days in. I know this comes down to will power, and not smoking, but i’m curious as to how relapsing affects a tolerance breaks progress. say it will take me 30 days to completely reset my tolerance. I start my break, i went 3 days without smoking. and then i smoked, just a bowl. Would i be set back to 30 days completely ? or after relapsing that one time after being sober for three days, would i only need to go , say , 28 more days (rather than 27 as i was 3 days in) to completely reset my tolerance ? after that bowl, would my tolerance sky rocket back up due to thc coming back into play before i’m completely reset tolerance wise? or do i just have slightly more of a tolerance than i did right before smoking, as i was already 3 days in? sorry if this question is confusing, it’s a bit hard to verbalize what i mean. 

2. Could i use cbd weed ? (AFAIK) it’s legal to source marijuana with <.3% thc online, so could i buy an ounce or two of cbd to get through the ritual part? At the same time, doesnt cbd bind to the same receptors as thc? Would i still be getting a tolerance break, or would that receptor still be “fried” at the end of my break due to the cbd use, preventing me from feeling the thc at the end of my tolerance break? Or would i be fine as it’s not thc binding to the receptors for a while?

3. Also, i’ve stumbled across delta 8 THC online, which is legal federally and in my state. Could i use delta 8 THC during my tolerance break as it’s different from delta 9 thc? or are the two chemicals similar enough to the point where it wouldn’t allow my tolerance to reset?

228,llc5so,rawzombie26,Wait until the end of the day to do your preferred substance,"Hello all,

 Just got back into smoking after a year or so of off and on smoking because weed doesn’t feel good anymore. The other day I got a Delta 8 cart, If you don’t know what that is look it up cause delta 8 slaps. Past few days I would hit it a few times and be slightly elevated during the day. Then the other day I didn’t smoke until I was done with my day and could relax and damnnnnn waiting made it sooo much better.

If you vape you know what I mean by the first hit of the day is the best by far. After knowing this I’m not going back. Of course if it’s your day off do whatever you want. Personally waiting for the end of the day now is one of the best parts of the experience.

After a long day, just kick back, hit my cart and relax with my bb. Nothing beats it.

<p>Just got back into smoking after a year or so of off and on smoking because weed doesn’t feel good anymore. The other day I got a Delta 8 cart, If you don’t know what that is look it up cause delta 8 slaps. Past few days I would hit it a few times and be slightly elevated during the day. Then the other day I didn’t smoke until I was done with my day and could relax and damnnnnn waiting made it sooo much better.</p>

<p>If you vape you know what I mean by the first hit of the day is the best by far. After knowing this I’m not going back. Of course if it’s your day off do whatever you want. Personally waiting for the end of the day now is one of the best parts of the experience.</p>

Quick background, I have used many drugs over my 14 + years as a drug user but never got deep into opiates or stimulants as they are rather not my thing. 

Recently I did ketamine (~2 weeks ago) had a great time and only did like .15 at most.

I am also currently on a small benzo taper from a month and a half of daily use. (~a week into taper) 

I take cbd daily and it works well with everything I have tried.

Now I took a 25mg delta 8 thc gummie, 2 grams of kratom and smoked Bout a .8 of bud 

2 hours later I was super nauseous out of nowhere, to the point of throwing up and had these trip like visions, trouble focusing and any noise made me want to throw up. Also had the verge of some seizures but I think this was from the confusion in my brain. This lasted for about 3 hours till I was able to go to sleep. 

Now when I smoke even a small amount like 2 hits I get this head tighhtness and uneasy feeling like I'm going into a trip. Could this be because I fried my serotonin receptors?

233,iphi88,thesmallestcock69,The best legal high combo out there (in my opinion),"So, you want to get High, but don’t have access to a reliable dopeman/plug/willythepillymilly? I got you. 

You shall need the following drugs (all of which are legal, in most states, except weed) 
1. Phenibut (500mg-1g should do. Make sure the doses are staggered in 250mg increments, every 30 min-1 hour. It’s actually more effective this way than one big dose) 

2. Kratom 

3. Caffeine (Yerba Mate and/or Guayusa are excellent beverages that provide more euphoria than coffee or energy drinks) 

4. Kava Kava (not the bunk pills, “extracts”, and other unknown vendors, but instead medium grind and/or micornized kava from a good vendor. The kava subreddit has a list of reliable ones) 

5. Delta-8 THC (Natural THC derivative that produced a high similar to THC, but without a mental high. The cucks at the DEA recently moved to ban it, but it’s still available for purchase on many of the vendors’ websites. Better hurry) 

6. Nicotine (yes, everyone’s favorite legal drug) 

7. The following supplements - Fish oil (helps the kava and Kratom effects become more pronounced), magnesium glycinate (helps with the Kratom buzz). 

Steps- 
1. Take supplements 

2. Start staggering the phenibut 

3. When you reach the 30 minute mark after your 500mg dose, begin to consume Kava BEFORE Kratom. 

4. Consume Kratom anytime after the first drink or two of Kava. 

5. Wait 30 min and then slam some caffeine in there. 

6. Wait about 1 hour exactly after Kratom sets in and smoke a fat willy. 

7. You are now extremely high, without much of a risk of overdose or dying (keep in mind, everything has its risks, but these drugs are very benign compared to what’s out there on the streets. Use caution, either way, you’ve been warned) 

8. (Optional)- if one happens to have some LSD or shrooms, I feel a micro dose would do this combo even more justice.

236,ldlcva,Bmoneysmug,"Addall XR (Phenibut, Phenylethylamine, and Octodrine) analysis and review","This is an analysis of the popular Addall XR pills available at many Head Shops.

For whatever reason, there are two current formulations of this brand, each with identical packaging. Only the ingredient list on the back differs.

Formulation 1: Serving Size of 2 Capsules. Vitamin B1 (15mg), Vitamin B2 (21mg), Vitamin B6 (51mg), and 1413mg of a proprietary blend (Caffeine, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa Monnieri is a nootropic herb used for improving memory and reducing anxiety. This herb has some gastrointestinal side effects, but is generally safe. Overall this is the weakest formulation, and the caffeine is a more likely candidate for any non-placebo effects.

Formulation 2: Serving Size of 1 Capsule. 750mg of a proprietary blend (Beta-Phenyl-GABA, 1-Amino-2-phenylethane, and 2-Amino-6-methylheptane). Beta-Phenyl-GABA is another word for Phenibut, a Central Nervous System Depressant used as a prescription anxiolytic medication in Russia. Phenibut is a GABA-B agonist, and similar to other GABAergic drugs such as Alcohol and Baclofen, it actually produces mild stimulatory effects in certain dosages! This is due to the downstream effect, which increases the amounts of endogenous Phenylethylamine (PEA) which is believed to be responsible for the feelings of love/lust. While both GABA and Phenibut are GABA receptor agonists, Phenibut is far more psychoactive and also has a moderately high addiction potential. 1-Amino-2-phenylethane is also known as Phenylethylamine (PEA), as previously mentioned, and is a Central Nervous System Stimulant that regulates monoamine neurotransmission. PEA gets metabolized into an Amphetamine isomer, so there is a small possibility of a false-positive for Amphetamines on a particularly sensitive drug test. The effects of PEA can be very beneficial, although the duration is very short without redosing or MAOI supplementation; the half-life is only 5-10 minutes. Finally, 2-Amino-6-methylheptane is Octodrine (DMHA), a Central Nervous System Stimulant originally created as a nasal decongestant. It is chemically similar to the now banned DMAA, and it is useful for athletic performance and burning fat/losing weight. All 3 of these substances can cause nausea, especially Phenibut. This nausea is exacerbated by Alcohol consumption, primarily due to negative interactions between Phenibut and Alcohol (again, both are GABA agonists). These are all far more psychoactive than the ingredients in formulation 1, which is apparent by the ""Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while using this product"" disclaimer. Below, they mention drug interactions and general warnings.

I see a lot of reviewers claiming that they took both pills and became nauseous and over-stimulated. This is because they assumed that both of these formulations follow the same serving size, as the serving size for formulation 1 is both pills, while the serving size for formulation 2 is only 1 pill due to the obvious strength differences. 

Review:
After taking one pill (formulation 2), I felt mild stomach disturbances around the 45 minute mark, so I vaped some 70% Delta-8 THC. It's been a very subtle buzz, both euphoric and stimulatory. I also feel some mild sedation, but it could be due to the THC. The effects feel similar to a good stimulatory Kratom buzz, and the crash is very subtle. I also drank an energy drink halfway through to extend the stimulatory effects. Overall, the product is okay, but ultimately not worth the money. One week later, I combined one pill with 5 grams of Yellow Bali Kratom powder, and the synergy was amazing. I felt strong stimulatory effects, yet I could nod off as soon as I close my eyes. The sedation was definitely noticeable, and the effects lasted approximately 4 hours.

Final thoughts:
Although the effects from this brand can be very pleasant, I personally would not support this manufacturer. First of all, the different formulations are very shady. In addition, it gives a bad name to Phenibut, and the fact that most Head Shops carry these pills right next to the Kratom products is concerning.

<p>For whatever reason, there are two current formulations of this brand, each with identical packaging. Only the ingredient list on the back differs.</p>

<p>Formulation 1: Serving Size of 2 Capsules. Vitamin B1 (15mg), Vitamin B2 (21mg), Vitamin B6 (51mg), and 1413mg of a proprietary blend (Caffeine, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa Monnieri is a nootropic herb used for improving memory and reducing anxiety. This herb has some gastrointestinal side effects, but is generally safe. Overall this is the weakest formulation, and the caffeine is a more likely candidate for any non-placebo effects.</p>

<p>Formulation 2: Serving Size of 1 Capsule. 750mg of a proprietary blend (Beta-Phenyl-GABA, 1-Amino-2-phenylethane, and 2-Amino-6-methylheptane). Beta-Phenyl-GABA is another word for Phenibut, a Central Nervous System Depressant used as a prescription anxiolytic medication in Russia. Phenibut is a GABA-B agonist, and similar to other GABAergic drugs such as Alcohol and Baclofen, it actually produces mild stimulatory effects in certain dosages! This is due to the downstream effect, which increases the amounts of endogenous Phenylethylamine (PEA) which is believed to be responsible for the feelings of love/lust. While both GABA and Phenibut are GABA receptor agonists, Phenibut is far more psychoactive and also has a moderately high addiction potential. 1-Amino-2-phenylethane is also known as Phenylethylamine (PEA), as previously mentioned, and is a Central Nervous System Stimulant that regulates monoamine neurotransmission. PEA gets metabolized into an Amphetamine isomer, so there is a small possibility of a false-positive for Amphetamines on a particularly sensitive drug test. The effects of PEA can be very beneficial, although the duration is very short without redosing or MAOI supplementation; the half-life is only 5-10 minutes. Finally, 2-Amino-6-methylheptane is Octodrine (DMHA), a Central Nervous System Stimulant originally created as a nasal decongestant. It is chemically similar to the now banned DMAA, and it is useful for athletic performance and burning fat/losing weight. All 3 of these substances can cause nausea, especially Phenibut. This nausea is exacerbated by Alcohol consumption, primarily due to negative interactions between Phenibut and Alcohol (again, both are GABA agonists). These are all far more psychoactive than the ingredients in formulation 1, which is apparent by the &quot;Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while using this product&quot; disclaimer. Below, they mention drug interactions and general warnings.</p>

<p>I see a lot of reviewers claiming that they took both pills and became nauseous and over-stimulated. This is because they assumed that both of these formulations follow the same serving size, as the serving size for formulation 1 is both pills, while the serving size for formulation 2 is only 1 pill due to the obvious strength differences. </p>

<p>Review:
After taking one pill (formulation 2), I felt mild stomach disturbances around the 45 minute mark, so I vaped some 70% Delta-8 THC. It&#39;s been a very subtle buzz, both euphoric and stimulatory. I also feel some mild sedation, but it could be due to the THC. The effects feel similar to a good stimulatory Kratom buzz, and the crash is very subtle. I also drank an energy drink halfway through to extend the stimulatory effects. Overall, the product is okay, but ultimately not worth the money. One week later, I combined one pill with 5 grams of Yellow Bali Kratom powder, and the synergy was amazing. I felt strong stimulatory effects, yet I could nod off as soon as I close my eyes. The sedation was definitely noticeable, and the effects lasted approximately 4 hours.</p>

<p>Final thoughts:
Although the effects from this brand can be very pleasant, I personally would not support this manufacturer. First of all, the different formulations are very shady. In addition, it gives a bad name to Phenibut, and the fact that most Head Shops carry these pills right next to the Kratom products is concerning. It seems that the manufacturers have an obsession with producing counterfeit prescription drugs; this is evident by their other product, XanRelax (containing Mitragynine, the primary alkaloid of Kratom. Plus, this product is very overpriced at 7.99 per pack, while the costs of high quality Phenibut HCL is much lower.</p>

237,kunnic,HamReduction,Fucking Terrifying Experience,"I haven't done a benzo in quite some time, two months, and thought I would take etizolam, 1mg, and do some light reading.

I wait for it to hit but nothing, After an hour, I dose 1 mg more.

Another hour passes, not feeling much. 1 more mg for a total of 3mg.

I let the etizolam hit and decided to smoke weed. I haven't smoked weed in two years but I just bought these delta-8 thc dabs and wanted to try them out.

I take a big rip because I know there will be no anxiety or panic since I am under etizolam's protection.

The dab smacks me in an amazing way. Made the overall experience better.

I decide to smoke some harmine due to its sedating nature. I smoke about 30mg and feel a subtle effect. Didn't do much for the overall experience.

I decided, ""why not smoke dmt"" (purely for its visuals), plus the knowledge of the fact harmine boosts the effects of dmt, I knew it was going to be fun. I stripped down to my boxers and readied my rig.

I love dmt and can handle it up to about 45-55mgs. Another past that is regretful for me.

I scale the dmt and see 30mg. I thnk that can't be right. I put it on a piece of paper, reset my scale, and dump it back on. still reads 30mg. Okay, it's 30 mg then.

I heat up the rig and take a full inhale, holding for 15-20 seconds.

It hit me with 5-10 seconds. The moment I blew out I knew I was fucked. I looked towards my room but it was too far away. I ran to the couch and plopped down.

Words can't describe the terror I experienced. The etizolam did not protect me. That was not 30mgs of dmt, it couldn't be. I once smoked 120mgs of dmt and it was something beyond that.

I entered a multiroomed, fractal, endless dimension where I could see every room at once from every angle. In each room ""they"", whoever they is, were dissecting my brain,  polishing its every part, and simultaneously staring at me with a tense glare.

I became taken over by a tingling sensation that left me paralyzed. Every cell in my body, vibrating. Even my tongue. The vibrations were broken down into geometrical patterns and they had colors to them. yellow, reds, mostly neons.

I  started to pray for this to be over this instant.

It didn't happen.

The tingling went on for what I believe to be ten minutes.  I glanced at my watch before the hit and the moment I finally could open my eyes.

For the next ten minutes, eternity ripped me apart. I tried to keep my eyes open to fight it, I tried to move to lessen the effects but they only pronounced it.

I focused on my breathing and tried not to vomit from terror. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My body started shivering and got colder by the milliseconds that passed by like years.

I couldn't take it and had to put on some clothes. I tried many times to move but each movement made me want to vomit.

The shivering continued. I'm in mental and psychical hell. I attempt to crawl to my closet but each movement is still too much. I say fuck it and stand up. I burst into my closet and force on a hoodie and climb into a pair of shorts.

The effects are finally dying down. I grab my phone and call my friend. Thank god he answers. I tell him what's happening and try to stay grounded in this experience. The effects die down much quicker now that my mind can be distracted with conversation.

We talk for a little and by the time the conversation was over I am not feeling the effects anymore.

In total, that was a 30 minutes dmt trip. I've combined harmine and dmt before many times.
