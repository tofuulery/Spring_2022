This is not a peer-reviewed scientific paper, if it were, the paper would note things like:  


* A large segment of the Delta8 THC market is adulterated gray-market products with unknown contents.   

* The Delta9 THC market is a mix of flower, oil vaping, and edible products.  The Delta8 market is largely dominated by oil vaping products, with edibles second, there is no natural flower.  


One would have to study both markets and create some sort of model that can be used to more accurately compare the two.  That would probably be only comparing respiratory issues of D9 vaping to D8 vaping, and clearly defining what a respiratory issue is.  Someone hyperventilating after an edible and lung cancer are both respiratory issues on standardized reports.

I am not suggesting that Delta8 is safe or safer than Delta9.  Vaping anything carries numerous health risks, and Delta8 may carry numerous health risks in any form.
