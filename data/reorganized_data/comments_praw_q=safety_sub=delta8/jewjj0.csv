The general consumer sees ""regulation"" as a bad word, but it's something that can mean the difference between you vaping Distillate and vaping Mystery Chemicals.

The average consumer doesn't look at this and see it as being a problem but it TRULY is.  If a company can't even afford to invest in proper scientific scales, what makes you think that they are going to be concerned about what's going in the cart?  The general consumer isn't concerned with the process, and in my opinion ...that really sucks.  By educating the consumer about the process, they can (and will) make a better decision about where they want to spend their money.

Compliant labels are something that is a HUGE deal.  I've seen this more in the packaging of D8 Edibles.  If you really want to understand why it's a huge deal, look no further than the Medical/Rec or the Ecig Industry.  If it's one thing that the FDA doesn't like...it's knock-off packaging that ""looks like"" something else.  The quickest way to gain the wrong kind of attention is by selling an intoxicant in a package that could be mistaken as normal candy.

Why aren't more companies putting their cartridges in Child-Proof containers?  This is something that companies can very easily start doing right now in order to give their product validity, and also give their customer peace of mind.  I get it...no one is telling them to do it...but why not focus on being compliant before a ruling comes that ""forces"" you to make that adjustment.  Sure it will cost the company more money to change over packaging, but it's much cheaper than throwing away packaging that you simply can't use due to being non-compliant.

It's going to be interesting to see whether or not these companies stick around when there are regulations placed upon Delta-8-THC.  That will be the real deciding factor in where my money goes. I'm watching them like a hawk tbh.

Maybe I'm just entirely too cynical about all of this...but I definitely want to know that the products that I'm ingesting are safe, and have had MANY sets of eyes checking over them, EVERY step of the way.
