* customer, vendor and community communication with the latter two being public.
* continually changing labs, glass and carts based on current industry and community recommendations 
* publicly verifiable identities of all investors
* new investors are publicly vetted and the community would have the ability to refuse a new investor.
* no investor is allowed to have more than an equal share of the co-op and agrees to sell their interest if they cannot adhere to the above mandates.

Like you anyone can say anything without any basis in fact and next thing you know it is a mass freakout based on no facts. The opportunistic bad guys thrive in this sort of scenario so you actually perpetuate the worst elements of the problems - more confusion.

Then you suggest relying on a COA's ALONE is enough when anyone could source a COA and slip in a whole other product. This happens all the time in this industry D8 not the only product. Oh, and I like R33F, but to say because so and so said so it ok. Sorry man but it is time for you to go grab your Delta 8 book and your distillate book and study up some more as this is a fail.

Example in point: How long has the myth been allowed to run, and has been accepted, the higher concentration of Delta 8is proof the product is purer? Well surprise surprise I have been telling you that for 5 month this is NOT TRUE.. But then again making no effort to sort out fact from fiction and these sorts of post perpetuate the environment that allow the bad elements to thrive.  

**The proof is in the pudding they say and if you can do with the D8 your buying what this dude in the video is doing with ours well likely the stuff is really good. How many of you can actually say you could do this**

To the point of being misleading like so many other posts. You generalize a lot of information and imply some sort total understanding, but in fact cast a negative light on everything and provide no solution.</p>
