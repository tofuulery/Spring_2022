When smoking true marijuana flower, you’re also getting a more full spectrum cannabis which means you’re getting your CBD, CBG, CBN, etc. which can impact your experience as well. This is why D8 purity is super important, because you’re getting what you want (and frankly, what you’re paying for).

People react differently to different cannabis derivatives. But also, terpene profile plays a huge role as well. When selecting a D8 brand you’ll want to keep in mind that legally compliant D8 is derived from Cannabis Sativa L (hemp), so terpenes are important. You should know that if you’re looking for something stimulating you’ll want to go with a Sativa terpene, whereas an Indica will be more mellow and chill (just like your typical flower strains with D9). You also want transparency in what’s in the terpenes and where they come from.

A good resource is CBD Hemp Library which is a D8 and CBD review channel on YouTube that reviews the effects of different brands so if you go through their channel you may find something that sounds appealing to you.

We offer 5 different terpene flavors (each with their own CoA’s) which are botanically-derived (as opposed to cannabis or synthetically derived). If you’re interested in our brand, we invest a lot in making sure our product is produced by manufacturers with a lot of certifications, including API certifications which is one of the hardest to get. D8 is an unregulated industry so we jump through a lot of hoops to ensure the safety of our product. As others may point out, there are some cheaper brands out there but in my honest opinion you get what you pay for.

There are several other great products out there that the community loves that you should look in to as well. I’d recommend getting a high purity D8 product that gives you a sense of how D8 effects you and then start to play with other derivatives like CBD to really tailor the cannabis experience you’re looking for.",False,,,t1_gby28z4,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>On the whole, D8 is reportedly more of a “clear” high and less intense than D9.
