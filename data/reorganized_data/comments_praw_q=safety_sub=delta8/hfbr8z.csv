My first run was a learning experience, and it still is a learning experience! 

Same batch of  around 4g STR distillate with 1g decarbed sugar wax, 5g total, this time added with 0.4-0.45 ml of hemp derived terps (incredible hulk).
Roughly around 9% terps.

The carts are nice and slow moving at room temp and act somewhat viscous when heated. Maybe next time I should use less terps, very strong in terp taste but not a turn off at all. Nice and powerful effects! The D8/D9 mix and all the other cannabinoids really put me down any time during the day!

Edit: I forgot to mention the carts. In comparison to last batch, the oil was too thick to wick and the carts produced clouds, but I had to wait in between hits for more oil in the coil. This batch though, clouds for days, and ready for another hit in seconds! I'm extremely happy on how this came out and can't wait for more projects in the future!",1593041326.0,,,t1_fvwk4ob,True,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Round 2 of delta-8 cart making.
