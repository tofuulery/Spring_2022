6,hguh4v,highermonkey,Don't sleep on Greene Rush Hemp's Distillate,"I've known about hemp derived d8 for a while now.  But most of the companies offering it seemed relatively sketchy, to me.  When I saw Greene Rush Hemp was offering d8 disty, I decided to give it a whirl.  Their CBD products have always been legit.

Picked up some of their distillate, flavored with Blue Dream cannabis derived terpenes.  Threw a little in my dab pen.  Holy shit... the flavor on this stuff was incredible.  It tasted like a quality dispensary concentrate.  The closest thing I could compare it to would be a Raw Garden cart.  But smoother.  No throat irritation whatsoever.

The effects were pretty impressive as well.  I'd describe it as 70-80% of a delta9 experience.  Some of that missing 20-30% I don't miss.  The disorientation and anxiety.  Some of it I do miss.  Delta9 is mildly psychedelic (or majorly when eaten).  I also found it to be more of a ""head high"".  There was very little body load.  But it really ""brightened"" my evening, if that makes sense.  This d8 with a beer made for a wonderful pro-social experience.

I can get quality dispensary d9 concentrates for about $30 per gram.  The same price as the Greene Rush d8.  Even so... I'm seriously considering replacing some of my normal d9 buys with d8.  While I miss some of the ""heavier"" aspects of d9, there are many situations where missing them makes more sense.

In short, don't sleep on Greene Rush Hemp's stuff.  It tastes like actual cannabis, not veggie terps.  He ships it with a lab report.  And the effects are top-notch.

11,hxgav0,Bassomatic42,Criticism of Blackwater Hemp Cartridges,"u/blackwaterhemp

So I really don't know much about this company, how it's run, who's behind it, or whether it's quality distillate as I've only had one of their cartridges at this point \*sundae driver\* . Overall the experience was pleasant, albeit a bit intense for a d8 cart. In comparison to the two others I had from 3chi and 10dc, it certainly was the most cerebral and psychedelic feeling of the three.

The company is based out of Tennessee. You can see this on his Reddit profile home, however, there is little info besides this. They also offer things such as CBD flower and d8 Distillate syringes like a lot of other d8 sources.

My criticism;

Besides the great service, shipping times, and communication with me about orders my first complaint is with the packaging.

The product states on the page to have between 93%-99% d8THC per 1ml. On the back of the packaging for the cartridge, however, it states ""9500mg of d8THC""

I know it was probably a simple typo but definitely not a good look when you're making mistakes like that.

(2) They have tested positive for levels of lead within the distillate. Not in the cartridge, in the distillate. However, it is still within the safe boundaries of under .5ug/g

(3) Previous samplings and lab reports from this company come from a certain Stewart Andy from **HCL CBD.** The only thing I can find out about him is his LinkedIn profile.

[**https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-stewart-1766b11a3**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-stewart-1766b11a3)

(4) is d8 supposed to be super cerebral and mind-bending? In my experience with other brands, all I really felt was a mellow body high, completely different than what I experienced with BWH. 

Not quite sure what to make of it all.

**The Things that I like about the company:**

(1) Official CCell (verifiable)

(2) Viscous oil that's crystal clear/slightly pink/hits hard

(3) Fast shipping

(4) Ok Terpenes.

(5) Reasonable Pricing.

(6) Great Communication (So far)

I am not against hemp derived edibles. If it were up to me you could buy LSD at the gas station. But it's not up to me, so this is still illegal and thus not regulated. We all look for lab reports when buying our D8 but hardly anyone thinks about this food being processed most likely in somebody's kitchen. Did they wear gloves or masks? Was it left out for hours in heat? Is it cross-contaminated? Is the packaging food grade? Did they have a bad day and sneeze on it and just not care? You really have no idea and most companies don't talk about any of this stuff at all. 

Personally edibles are the one thing I will not touch from any company. I've worked in the food industry and I have seen the type of shit that goes down in places that get regularly inspected. Imagine what these guys can get away with. Not that they necessarily would, but they could, and honestly might not even be aware of what sort of food standards they need to uphold. Not all of it is just common sense and what kind of food you make effects it greatly. Some brownies are fine for months at room temp because they load it with preservatives.

17,g7f27s,zootroopic,CannaAid day 2,"I got my carts yesterday. For reference, I  finished my second, licensed 3:2 d9THC:CBD cartridge from Michigan the day before the CannaAid carts arrived. I got Durban Poison and GDP. Some people have reported that their DP carts are 1:1 d8:CBD but mine said 65% d8. First off, I can tell you that these are not 1ml carts. There's no way. The centerpost is much thicker than an actual CCELL cart and I've noticed that they are draining faster than expected. I have not had any leakage but the oil does clog up the coil so that you need to suck the shit out of it to get it to work. I sent them an email asking what gives, haven't gotten a reply, so I went to insta and asked the same thing. They told me that they just got a new gun and that it measures exactly 1ml. I don't buy it. Now for the effects. The effects are definitely stronger than CBD or CBG in any form. I was expecting d8 to be around 70% the strength of d9 based on what people have said. What I can say is that to me, the CannaAid d8 carts feel weaker than the 3:2 d9:CBD carts I just had, especially the DP which makes me wonder if it really is 1:1 d8:CBD. It's also true that the CannaAid carts are not very potent to begin with. Overall, I can't really complain with how much I paid for them with the 420 sale, but I don't think I'll order from CannaAid again. They don't offer the transparency and quality that can be found elsewhere in the hemp marketplace.

Does anyone know if 10DC has switched over to the ceramic carts for the .5s for good, or are they just an anomaly? This would also be my first time trying a full ceramic cart, so I’m curious as to what I’m getting.

26,ix26oo,betterdaze2020,Detailed Medicinal Dreams Review: A Critic's Perspective,"Greetings fellow d8 enthusiasts. It is me, the dude who ripped MD a new )*( last week. I'm here to say that my 2 orders (one from the 21st of August, the other from the 27th)  finally came almost a full month after ordering. Let's get down to business. 

Shipping: 2.5/5

When I placed my first order it said 7 days processing time, when I placed my second order it said 7-10 days processing time. Both took longer than than quoted to get out. Possitives>The package was intact when I received it, nothing broken, paper protecting the products, nothing related to hemp or CBD on the package. Negatives>Everything was just thrown in a box without any protection besides a few pieces of paper but it did get here fine. There was no notice to law enforcement in this package. It took almost a full month.

Packaging: 3/5

Nothing is properly labeled besides the tincture, however, everything was sealed tightly and the packaging they use is easy to deal with. The jars they use for the D8 had a nasty residual factory (something I've encountered with other companies too) smell when heated but the smell/odor did not transfer over to the distillate. I believe it is just the plastic cap that creates this smell so don't do a hot water bath with the cap on if you care about that. You will NEVER be able to get the last .2g of dist out of these jars unless you rinse with ethanol but that is an issue encountered with every small jar I've bought of d8 (with the exception of the legendary green rush 6.5g jars which are the GOAT for d8.) Overall if they bought/used a label maker for their products 95% of their package issues would be fixed but we all know that takes time which would have delayed orders even worse than they already were. 

Product: 5/5 

Ima be real with you... its good...  like almost cannaclear good... I actually realized while comparing lab results that cannaclear and MD both have labs from altitude labs showing near the same results, same with Denex. I'd be shocked if the 3 had different suppliers, at the very least they are likely purchasing product from the same extractor. They all have different batches/labs up rn but I wouldn't be surprised, with a little digging, if I found out they all used the same source. With that being said cannaclear distillate is better imo because it's less oxidized, less taste, and a trustworthy source... HOWEVER the potency is nearly indistinguishable if I'm being honest. The CBG is legit, the hemp gummies worked well, I got a little disposable pen thrown in with my order that seems fine but I wont touch it without seing a heavy metals report on the cartridge. None of my jars of d8 weighed the same. Most were on point within .05g but 2 were short roughly .15g and 3 or 4 were over by between .15g and .7g. Overall I got roughly 1.5g more than I paid for in total. CBG was exactly 1g, isolate a little over 1g. I received the correct amount of products. 

Ethics: 2.5/5 

This company has made some questionable business decisions that I believe fall into the moral grey area. They paid for reviews, were very rude to people who disagreed with them or asked for help with missing items, allowed people to jump in line by paying extra shipping, and to this day make posts about our community on facebook calling us clowns for pointing out their bulshit. Now you may be asking yourself ""Betterdaze why would you give them a 2.5/5 if they are acting like such dicks?"" Well my friends the answer is simple, they actually shipped the orders. Actions speak louder than words, they can moan about our community as much as they want but at the end of the day they begrudgingly accepted they had to close shop to catch up on orders and did so. They haven't publicly taken responsibility for their actions BUT they seem to have implemented measures to tackle the issues brought up by me and many others. We will see if they continue to head in the right direction. 

Conclusion: 

This place is like the Waffle House of the delta 8 world. Should you walk into a crouded waffle house on a Saturday morning expecting the best service of your life? Fuck no. Do you expect to be seated the second you walk in the door? Fuck no. Do you expect your mug to not have a little smudge on it? Fuck no. But will you get a delicious breakfast at an affordable price after waiting what seems like an eternity? Yes, yes you will. At the end of the day you need to ask yourself ""Does the cheap price make up for their short-falls?"" Many will say yes, many will say no but at the end of the day that is your decision. I personally will not be ordering from them again until they prove capable of conducting themselves properly. I simply cannot rationalize supporting them with this many great companies available for a couple dollars more. With that being said, I recognize that times are tough right now and saving some bills is more important than ever. I will say this, they are not a scam, it is definitely real d8, and you will either get your order or they will refund you. If they still offer it pay with paypal (goods and services only) or a credit card in case anything goes wrong. If you are short on bills and don't mind potentially waiting several weeks you would likely be fine ordering from them.

It is me, the dude who ripped MD a new )*( last week. I&#39;m here to say that my 2 orders (one from the 21st of August, the other from the 27th)  finally came almost a full month after ordering. Let&#39;s get down to business. </p>

<p>Shipping: 2.5/5</p>

<p>When I placed my first order it said 7 days processing time, when I placed my second order it said 7-10 days processing time. Both took longer than than quoted to get out. Possitives&gt;The package was intact when I received it, nothing broken, paper protecting the products, nothing related to hemp or CBD on the package. Negatives&gt;Everything was just thrown in a box without any protection besides a few pieces of paper but it did get here fine. There was no notice to law enforcement in this package. It took almost a full month.</p>

<p>Packaging: 3/5</p>

<p>Nothing is properly labeled besides the tincture, however, everything was sealed tightly and the packaging they use is easy to deal with. The jars they use for the D8 had a nasty residual factory (something I&#39;ve encountered with other companies too) smell when heated but the smell/odor did not transfer over to the distillate. I believe it is just the plastic cap that creates this smell so don&#39;t do a hot water bath with the cap on if you care about that. You will NEVER be able to get the last .2g of dist out of these jars unless you rinse with ethanol but that is an issue encountered with every small jar I&#39;ve bought of d8 (with the exception of the legendary green rush 6.5g jars which are the GOAT for d8.) Overall if they bought/used a label maker for their products 95% of their package issues would be fixed but we all know that takes time which would have delayed orders even worse than they already were. </p>

<p>Product: 5/5 </p>

<p>Ima be real with you... its good...  like almost cannaclear good... I actually realized while comparing lab results that cannaclear and MD both have labs from altitude labs showing near the same results, same with Denex. I&#39;d be shocked if the 3 had different suppliers, at the very least they are likely purchasing product from the same extractor. They all have different batches/labs up rn but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, with a little digging, if I found out they all used the same source.

30,il8v0b,j-mo37,Can confirm- 8Delta8 is no good,"Background- I've been a regular user of D9 on and off for years, and have been using D8 for a over a month. The only place I have ordered D8 from so far was Mycbdhaven. 

I decided to give 8Delta8 a go and purchased 4 carts from them. The day after I completed my order I started seeing all of the negative posts about 8D8 on this sub (sketchy labs, runny carts etc.). I decided to cancel my order. I placed my order last Monday and I sent multiple emails to them requesting to cancel my order, but received no response. Their website is very minimal; the only way to contact them is via email. No phone # is present on the site. My order finally ended up shipping last Friday. I figured I might as well test the product for you guys since it had already been shipped. Time to see if the negative reviews were valid.

The carts themselves appeared to be authentic ccells. The oil wasn't as watery as some users reported, but it was much more runny than MCH's disty. 8D8 oil will move around a little bit in the cart when turned upside down, while the MCH doesn't move at all. I decided to try out the mango kush flavor. The oil smelled amazing so I was optimistic... until I took a hit. Right away I could tell that they overdid it on the terpenes, it tasted like I was inhaling air freshener. Taking a hit off an 8D8 cart is literally like hitting cheap, fruit-flavored e-liquid. Overwhelming artificial fruit flavor and harsh on the lungs when trying to hold in the smoke. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they use PG or VG in their carts.

Now on to effects: I don't have a particularly high tolerance.  I take1-2 fat hits of MCH d8 everyday to get to a good level for a few hours. I took 7 hits of the 8d8 over the course of an hour and I still didn't get near the feeling that 1 hit of MCH gets me. I felt a slight body-high/couch-lock sensation from the 8d8 carts, but it was not enjoyable. After taking so many hits, I got a headache that I've yet to experience while using D8. Also, I felt a slight tightness in my chest. The only other time I've felt this is when I used to vape e-liquid years ago.

Overall, I would stay far away from 8delta8. Terrible customer service, and a disappointing product. Not to mention the sketchy labs/unknown contents. To make matters even worse, they are trying to charge $40 for a single cart lol. Save you the trouble and buy from a quality vendor. I recommend MCH, but there are many other good vendors out there.",1599060333.0,,Reviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/comments/il8v0b/can_confirm_8delta8_is_no_good/,30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fbef8f02820>,,delta8,t2_z2o3n,False,,0,False,[],r/delta8,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_il8v0b,False,light,0.92,,76,self.delta8,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,76,,False,False,self,,False,,[],{},,,True,public,text,0,,,text,0,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Background- I&#39;ve been a regular user of D9 on and off for years, and have been using D8 for a over a month.

31,idqfbp,MYCBDHAVEN,OFFICIAL MYCBDHAVEN D8 ANNOUNCEMENT!,"Well I am a silver lining guy so will get into that in a minute, but first the more pressing issue.


WE HAVE STOPPED ALL SALES OF D8 AS OF 7PM THIS EVENING AND PLAN TO ONLY SHIP WHAT ORDERS HAVE BEEN PLACED ALREADY. WE ARE GOING TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.REMEMBER THEY DID THE SAME THING TO CBD AND THAT DID NOT STICK. HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE AN INJUNCTION OR SOMETHING UNTIL IT IS SORTED OUT. NOT SURE THE DETAILS OTHER THAN THE PRONOUNCEMENT EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOW HEARD. WE WILL SEE. A WORK IN PROGRESS!



If you have a standing order in and have concerns please contact us via the website with an order number and the concern. We will be very busy I guess so give us time to process through the different questions and concerns. We will not be able to respond here at Reddit regarding these matters. You must contact us via website – PLEASE INCLUDE ORDER NUMBER!


**SILVER LINING STUFF:**


The Hemp supporters have a goal and target now. They will attack hard.



D8 has gotten out of control in many regards this will help organize the whole market. We are in a market where you can make a perfectly good simple distillate out of Sour Diesel flower  and people raise hell because it taste like ...uh well diesel...yet someone can manufacture a highly concentrated D8 product with residual zinc in it and all is good. I have been communicating with our lab all day today trying to work with standardization for D8 testing. I am in discussion with the General Manager who is very knowledgeable and things look promising. These discussions address D8 and THC confusions during testing, which is an issue with all cannabinoids actually. Testing for potentially toxic material specific to D8 in concentrated form (~ 85% and up) and/or distinguishing between simple distillation and these more refined process’s. More on all this later.



Yes this effects non legal THC states hard, the fight is on, but it is now another marijuana product nothing really changes there. We are not licensed to participate in that so no local business online or otherwise for the time being.


 
This pause in the action will allow companies to reorganize and get better as the sun comes back up for D8. We will expand our flavors for CBG and CBD and those offering in the meantime. Just give us some time to do this. Trust us on this satisfaction is available with these products!

<p>WE HAVE STOPPED ALL SALES OF D8 AS OF 7PM THIS EVENING AND PLAN TO ONLY SHIP WHAT ORDERS HAVE BEEN PLACED ALREADY. WE ARE GOING TO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.REMEMBER THEY DID THE SAME THING TO CBD AND THAT DID NOT STICK. HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE AN INJUNCTION OR SOMETHING UNTIL IT IS SORTED OUT. NOT SURE THE DETAILS OTHER THAN THE PRONOUNCEMENT EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOW HEARD. WE WILL SEE. A WORK IN PROGRESS!</p>

<p>If you have a standing order in and have concerns please contact us via the website with an order number and the concern. We will be very busy I guess so give us time to process through the different questions and concerns. We will not be able to respond here at Reddit regarding these matters. You must contact us via website – PLEASE INCLUDE ORDER NUMBER!</p>

<p><strong>SILVER LINING STUFF:</strong></p>

<p>The Hemp supporters have a goal and target now. They will attack hard.</p>

<p>D8 has gotten out of control in many regards this will help organize the whole market. We are in a market where you can make a perfectly good simple distillate out of Sour Diesel flower  and people raise hell because it taste like ...uh well diesel...yet someone can manufacture a highly concentrated D8 product with residual zinc in it and all is good. I have been communicating with our lab all day today trying to work with standardization for D8 testing. I am in discussion with the General Manager who is very knowledgeable and things look promising. These discussions address D8 and THC confusions during testing, which is an issue with all cannabinoids actually. Testing for potentially toxic material specific to D8 in concentrated form (~ 85% and up) and/or distinguishing between simple distillation and these more refined process’s. More on all this later.</p>

<p>Yes this effects non legal THC states hard, the fight is on, but it is now another marijuana product nothing really changes there. We are not licensed to participate in that so no local business online or otherwise for the time being.</p>

<p>This pause in the action will allow companies to reorganize and get better as the sun comes back up for D8. We will expand our flavors for CBG and CBD and those offering in the meantime. Just give us some time to do this. Trust us on this satisfaction is available with these products! Our new combinations not yet released are targeted to provide the same relief D8 did and within the framework of DEA ruling today!</p>

32,hf3sve,3ChiHemp,Gooooood Morning!,"Hey guys, what's new? Did I miss anything?

So for anyone new, I'm running a growing company and literally carving out a market from scratch so I have very limited time to get in here. There's a ton of work to be done to make sure this industry stays legal and this product gets in the hands of people that need it so that's our primary focus.  I'm sincerely happy that you all have access to this awesome cannabinoid since we launched it in the hemp space just under a year ago, but please realize this industry is much bigger than Reddit. Reddit didn't catch on to D8THC for 6-7 months after we were up and running and already in hundreds of stores. Reddit is a great place to talk about D8THC, but it's not the center of the universe. There are many, many individuals out there who could benefit from D8THC not on Reddit and we are aimed at getting this to them, too. Please be understanding of that.

Before I address the negative people let's focus on the good ones. To the many people in this sub who are getting out and actually doing positive things for D8THC and pushing the industry forward: you're awesome! Thank you! What you're doing continues to work. We still get comments every day from stores saying ""a customer told me about you"". The D8THC army is growing. And for the ones policing irrational comments about ALL vendors in here, thank you. Negativity never helps and it's great that you take the time out of your day to keep this sub honest and sane.

Now for the rest:

Credit card stuff - We use a third party secured processor. It's the same one used by probably every vendor in this sub and most in the hemp industry. If that company got hacked it would be EVERYWHERE. But it's not. It seems to have happened exclusively to the 4 people posting the most negative stuff online right now as we have not had it reported to us directly at all. Not one single claim was called or emailed into us. These claims are only showing up in Reddit. Even so, we ran scans on everything this morning and, of course, there are no breaches to be found. We sell to far, far more than 4 people a day. If this was an issue we'd have hundreds of people telling us. Regardless, if somehow this is actually true, please send it to our contact page on the website with all the details of what happened and we will try to figure out what's going on. But we don't collect your card numbers. That's all done encrypted through the third party processor like with every other purchase made online. I honestly feel like this is 2005 and I'm explaining the internet to my dad with this.

Reviews - Every day we get some kind of veiled or direct extortion threat from people wanting free stuff in exchange for not leaving negative reviews on our site, Reddit, YouTube, etc. and when we don't cave in, guess what happens? Over the top negative reviews submitted to our site and/or a new guy running wild on Reddit. Every. Single. Day.

Pricing - I can make every type of D8THC oil on the market right now and then some. I have a method that produces \~100% identifiable cannabinoids (95-99% D8THC & 1-5% CBC/D10 & CBN) ([testing proof here](https://www.3chi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DVT_2003134-01.pdf)), \~100% cannabinoids (85-90% D8THC & the new THC variant, D10THC, CBN, and exo-THC) (testing coming when we determine that final cannabinoid - the D10THC and exo THC are actually verified in a test) and then I can make a 90-95% D8THC oil ([testing proof here](https://www.3chi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bulk-delta-8-thc-lab-grade-92.jpg)), a 75-85% D8THC oil with up to 10% additional cannabinoids ([testing proof here](https://www.3chi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulk-Delta-8-THC-Lab-Grade-1.jpg)) as well as oils <74%. I show this to you as proof I know exactly what I'm talking about next. In the time it would take me to make 42kg of 75-85% oil on comparable equipment I can make \~7kg of our oil and the per kg costs are twice the amount with even more additional costs on consumables. So time costs are 6x higher/kg and input costs are \~3x higher to make our oil. That's why it costs more in addition to a lot of other forward-thinking compliance costs, some cool other programs we'll be launching for the market, customer service people, etc.

Shipping - I think we finally found out the reason we're having so many issues with tracking. We have a couple of mail carriers that pick up for us so we started accompanying the packages out to the mail truck at pickup sensing something was off. And that's where we found one of our mail carriers outright refuses to scan our packages at pickup. So this likely explains why about 1/3 to 1/2 of the shipments are getting no tracking, and also saying they are in preshipment long after they've left our warehouse. I'm guessing, but I imagine this has something to do with why they move slower in transit too. As of yet, there's been no indication we will be assigned a new carrier even though we've asked. If there's a mail carrier reading this that knows how to solve this situation please let us know!

To the people who are patient with these things, thank you. You are enjoyable to work with and service and it makes it a lot easier to focus on cool new things like bringing new cannabinoids to market. To everyone else, understand this movement is bigger than any one person's experience with ANY one vendor here. If you have a favorite vendor lift them up. If you have a problem with ANY vendor start by talking to them directly through customer service. Do not assume the worst. If you get definitive proof of something bad AND have exhausted all methods of reaching out to the customer service department of the company AND have waited at least a few days in case they are busy THEN come in and tell people about it if you absolutely must. But if you're not doing all those things first, do not pretend to be commenting as in here as if you are on the side of the D8THC industry. The negativity is the worst thing for the industry.

This sub still has a ton of potential to be a nucleus for a very, very good thing in human history. But it can go a lot of different ways. I hope it stays positive.

With that said I'm going to bed. I pulled an all-nighter and am exhausted. I'm sure there will be follow up comments to this but I honestly don't have a good time frame on when I'll be back to answer them. I'll do my best to make it soon, possibly here and there throughout the day later, but as we grow my time gets stretched thinner and thinner. Me not answering you does not mean I'm hiding or ignoring you. If you want D8THC around long term please understand there are a lot of non-Reddit things that need to be done to ensure that happens.",1593015082.0,Vendor,Information,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/comments/hf3sve/gooooood_morning/,32,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fbef8f02820>,,delta8,t2_68zd3x96,False,,0,False,[],r/delta8,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_hf3sve,False,light,0.95,#46d160,117,self.delta8,{},,68d1b2c6-8427-11ea-acfc-0e360c3b68ab,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,117,,False,False,self,,1593040541.0,,[],{},self,,True,public,text,0,,,text,0,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hey guys, what&#39;s new?

I just received the labs for the cartridges, the distillate is the 72% Delta alternatives, the link included is a full 10 page report. I will be getting screen grabs so its a little easier to view as well.</p>

35,gj5eri,Strangetimer,1200mg 3chi D8 Tincture Arrival,"Hey everyone, your favorite lab rat is back again but this time with 3chi's strongest tincture. Once again I will be hosting a live experience report thread tonight starting around 10:00PM EST. I plan on having this one run quite a bit slower than the last report. Given the duration of the experience and the lengthy comeup, there will most likely be fewer live posts and a larger debriefing post the morning afterwards. But I'd love to see you guys in the thread anyways! I'll still be answering questions, however I might not be able to get back to you the minute you post it like the vape cart review thread. 

I plan on dosing 2ml (80mg) of the tincture. *HOWEVER* I do have a question for you guys. I am not sure whether to dose orally (put the tincture on a cookie or something and eat it) or sublingually (holding the oil under the tongue). I know consuming D8 orally results in it's metabolism into 11-OH-THC, a higher potency cannabinoid. However, oral D8 is not very bioavailable and will result in a lower dosage. Sublingual administration on the other hand will provide a much higher dosage of D8 due to its higher sublingual bioavailability, however very little of the D8 will undergo metabolism into 11-OH-THC due to sublingual administration bypassing first pass metabolism. Anyone have any thoughts?

I just picked up a cart from my local CBD dispensary here in Asheville, NC. The cart name is Drift and is manufactured by Ratoon Agro in Marion NC. 

Anyone have experience with this brand? My partner and I have hit it a few times and it seems really good! 

Here is the lab testing:

37,g5htkr,Dub_Coast,Updates - The Quest For Answers,"So I have been delving into finding out more about the company CannaAid, specifically their delta-8 cartridges. 

Here's what I know: 

The lab (Altitude Consulting) has verified the authenticity of their CoA report (cannabinoids only). 

So I reached back to the lab to ask about fillers/cutting agents, the answer wasn't what I wanted to hear personally - they said they can't say what or if any cutting agent is present because they're only calibrated for certain compounds. 

I reached out to CannaAid on IG - they are disputing being placed on the ""fake/dirty"" carts list on another subreddit. 

They informed me their full panel CoAs should be available come Friday. 


So, overall still a bit up in the air, while we don't yet know what fillers/cutting agents (if any) are in them (I am not making any claims that they have cutting agents, their rep assured me they did not so I have to take it at face value), I can confirm it appears they do contain delta-8 in the amounts they advertise.
