To point out, hospital capacity is not only dependant on the number of beds available to bring in and treat patients.  It also has to do with the number of staff available to treat those patients. By law, there are a specified limit on how many patients can be under the charge of a nurse or physician.

 Example- a hospital has a capacity of 50 patients and 50 beds. Five nurses that can care for 10 people. Fire one of those nurses, your capacity is now 40. 10 of those beds will now sit empty. 

Vaccine mandates that reduce the number of health care staff directly impact that facility's capacity. These are self-defeating policies.  Hospitals nationwide, and the public they care for, are directly impacted by this.

Our nation's doctors, nurses, and other specialists already go through great lengths,  PPE-wise, to limit the transmission of pathogens to and from patients they care for. They are the largest PPE-protected line of work when it comes to this. 

Set aside the whole anti-vax argument. These are extraordinary times and we need to do all we can to ensure our health care workers and facilities are available to meet this demand. Firing them is only adding fuel to the fire. 

Add in, should we not also be doing all we can on treating through therapeutics to keep people out of the hospitals to begin with? Why are we not investing in already existing medications in fighting this? There are a number of other drugs and therapies that appear to be help.  It's foolish to ignore these other options.

COVID sucks. I had it. I have also gotten my shots.  I got the 'Vid before the shots were available. I've known a few people who either died (one just this week alone), or were hospitalized in medically-Induced comas and on a ventilator due to this shit. They all had one thing I common- they were in shit health to begin with.. all were what is considered obese and had many other health issues.. 

We need to be fighting this with all we have. Not just having our hopes on some fucking ""vaccine"" that clearly isn't the savior it was implied to be.",False,,,t1_hphqa4r,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Part of the problem with our hospitals being &quot;overrun&quot; are the policies put in place that are reducing the staffing of these hospitals. </p>

<p>To point out, hospital capacity is not only dependant on the number of beds available to bring in and treat patients.  It also has to do with the number of staff available to treat those patients. By law, there are a specified limit on how many patients can be under the charge of a nurse or physician.</p>

<p>Example- a hospital has a capacity of 50 patients and 50 beds. Five nurses that can care for 10 people. Fire one of those nurses, your capacity is now 40. 10 of those beds will now sit empty. </p>

<p>Vaccine mandates that reduce the number of health care staff directly impact that facility&#39;s capacity. These are self-defeating policies.  Hospitals nationwide, and the public they care for, are directly impacted by this.</p>

<p>Our nation&#39;s doctors, nurses, and other specialists already go through great lengths,  PPE-wise, to limit the transmission of pathogens to and from patients they care for. They are the largest PPE-protected line of work when it comes to this. </p>

<p>Set aside the whole anti-vax argument. These are extraordinary times and we need to do all we can to ensure our health care workers and facilities are available to meet this demand. Firing them is only adding fuel to the fire. </p>
