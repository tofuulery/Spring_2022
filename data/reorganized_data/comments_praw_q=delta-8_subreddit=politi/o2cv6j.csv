The loophole is that only THC Delta-9 is illegal, but other configurations of THC that have more or less the same effect as Delta-9 are legalish. Delta-9 is the most common naturally occurring THC, but others like Delta-8 are also naturally occurring, but usually only in trace amounts. Cannabis producers can make Delta-8 from CBD, which is very clearly federally legal, and ship it around the country, often for pretty damn cheap, too. Delta-8 is referred as 'diet weed' in part because it doesn't cause nearly as much anxiety or paranoia and is a very mellow high.

The tricky part is finding a reliable seller online. I have a particular company I use, but to avoid looking like a shill... Look for cannabis product lines that show up in your sate's dispensaries, or other states dispensaries if your state doesn't allow medical cannabis. Lots of companies that sell CBD products that have been approved by state boards for use in dispensaries are also moving into Delta-8 THC production.
