0,hhx7dxj,t3_qf2a9f,,,"Holy shit the bit about you sitting in the cockpit and watching the plane crash that is so me lol I’m bipolar and when I have mania it’s a lot like you explained I feel ontop of the world I’ll tell people I’m gonna get rich and they look at me and say “yea me too” and I’m like “nah wtf how you gonna get rich” like somehow I’m magically better I’ll make irrational decisions idk how many girls ive quit talking to or broken up with because of that shit.
And everytime in the moment exactly what I’m thinking is “I’ll regret this later but idc” 

mania normally creeps out anytime I’m excited about something takes me by surprise 
I normally won’t notice until I’ve paced back and forth for 2 hours and I put myself in physical pain.

I’m confused though. Mania doesn’t effect the speech from what I’m aware of. Just makes you talk more. 
It is harder to make sense of things when you’re manic though so that could explain it. 
A lot of times I can’t put anything into words and I chose not to talk

Another thing. I smoke weed everyday and I actually use it to kill my mania but when I was around 14 or 15 I use to do a bunch of stupid drugs and shit and I fucked my brain up for a good 6 months definitely caused some brain damage.
I was hallucinating and genuinely thought I would be insane forever.
Idk how I made it out and I doubt the useless comment from a mentally ill drug addict helps any but it’s here :) good luck",3,1635117142.0,False,/r/Drugs/comments/qf2a9f/effects_of_delta_8_on_mentally_ill_brains/hhx7dxj/,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fe89a16b0d0>,qf2a9f,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fe89b25e040>,0,,False,,[],,,3,,t3_qf2a9f,,,[],False,,,0,False,,True,False,True,,,[],t5_2qh7l,False,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Holy shit the bit about you sitting in the cockpit and watching the plane crash that is so me lol I’m bipolar and when I have mania it’s a lot like you explained I feel ontop of the world I’ll tell people I’m gonna get rich and they look at me and say “yea me too” and I’m like “nah wtf how you gonna get rich” like somehow I’m magically better I’ll make irrational decisions idk how many girls ive quit talking to or broken up with because of that shit.
