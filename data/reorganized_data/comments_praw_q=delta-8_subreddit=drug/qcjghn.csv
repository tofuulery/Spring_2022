3,hhgqsux,t3_qcjghn,shimmerangels,Can't spell Melodrama without MDMA,"for me d8 edibles work better than thc edibles, but i don't live in a legal state and i've never made d9 edibles myself (only bought from plugs) so take from that what u will

as far as the high from carts goes (the only other d8 products i've tried), i've found that when my tolerance is low enough i get high as fuck, very similar to d9 but w much less anxiety and paranoia, and never that weird trippy feeling i sometimes get when i smoke for the first time after taking a few months off. tolerance builds quickly for me though, possibly quicker than it does w d9 but i'm not positive. if it's less potent than d9 i definitely haven't noticed. but i was also smoking like $6-10/g low-mid grade stuff so that could be the reason why.

atm i'm living with my parents so i can't smoke flower, and i don't trust street carts whatsoever bc i used them for a couple months and started having breathing problems. i can get d8 carts from a lil dispensary in my city, and while i know that doesn't 100% guarantee they're safe, i talked to a couple of ppl who had bought from them before and vouched for them. used them from june-september (currently on a t break) and i never had any problems breathing, and my cough that i had for like 2 years after vaping those street carts for a month hasn't come back.

vaporizing d9 flower is definitely still my preferred roa, but whenever i need to be super discrete i'll reach for d8 carts or gummies every time.",2,1634800279.0,False,/r/Drugs/comments/qcjghn/thoughts_on_delta_8/hhgqsux/,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7fe89c7da5b0>,qcjghn,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fe89b25e040>,t5_2qh7l,,False,,[],,,richtext,0,Drugs,383d9cd2-5835-11eb-a44b-0e88ea3139fb,,[],False,,,0,False,,True,False,True,t2_160fmh,,,[],False,1634800545.0,,,t1_hhgqsux,0,"[{'e': 'text', 't': ""Can't spell Melodrama without MDMA""}]",False,"<div class=""md""><p>for me d8 edibles work better than thc edibles, but i don&#39;t live in a legal state and i&#39;ve never made d9 edibles myself (only bought from plugs) so take from that what u will</p>
