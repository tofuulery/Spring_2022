If it works for you for sleep, there is no reason to give it up, it seems like it could be a valuable medicine for you, something that is much better than a lot of the alternatives you mentioned using prior to this, and seems like it will likely not have the same long and short time side effects as some of those more potent substances. 

I’ve found a good way to cut back is to use your dopamine reward system by being proud of yourself every time you choose not to use when it’s not actually benefiting you. The satisfaction that can be gained from being in control of yourself and disciplined can be sublime, lean into that. 

The other alternative is to adapt and learn how to function in the way you need while still being able to consume as you wish.
