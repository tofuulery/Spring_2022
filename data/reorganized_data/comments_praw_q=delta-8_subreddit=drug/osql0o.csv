13,h6r228j,t3_osql0o,Mr_Jack_Frost_,:shroom:,"As far as I know, cross-tolerance between smoking and edibles doesn’t exist, because your liver processes the edible into a different compound. Also, the dosage of edibles is similar to that of traditional psychedelics in that 50mg isn’t just double 25mg, it has an exponential building effect with each extra mg. 

For someone with little to no edible tolerance, I’m surprised you didn’t freak out more than you did. I take d9-D8 edibles daily, and have been at roughly the same dose for well over a month now, ~20-25mg either all d9, all d8, or half and half (which is extra awesome for some reason) and even though that’s a pretty low-end dose for seasoned veterans, I still get kinda nervous as it’s coming on sometimes.

Still, there’s always something my mind can become paranoid about, and it does occasionally happen. 

If you’re planning on taking D8 edibles again, my advice would be to SLOWLY increase your dosage until you find your sweet spot. Then stick with that sweet spot until your tolerance builds and it doesn’t give you a good effect any more.
