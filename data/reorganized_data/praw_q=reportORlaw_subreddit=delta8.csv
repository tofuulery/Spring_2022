0,ix26oo,betterdaze2020,Detailed Medicinal Dreams Review: A Critic's Perspective,"Greetings fellow d8 enthusiasts. It is me, the dude who ripped MD a new )*( last week. I'm here to say that my 2 orders (one from the 21st of August, the other from the 27th)  finally came almost a full month after ordering. Let's get down to business. 

Shipping: 2.5/5

When I placed my first order it said 7 days processing time, when I placed my second order it said 7-10 days processing time. Both took longer than than quoted to get out. Possitives>The package was intact when I received it, nothing broken, paper protecting the products, nothing related to hemp or CBD on the package. Negatives>Everything was just thrown in a box without any protection besides a few pieces of paper but it did get here fine. There was no notice to law enforcement in this package. It took almost a full month.

Packaging: 3/5

Nothing is properly labeled besides the tincture, however, everything was sealed tightly and the packaging they use is easy to deal with. The jars they use for the D8 had a nasty residual factory (something I've encountered with other companies too) smell when heated but the smell/odor did not transfer over to the distillate. I believe it is just the plastic cap that creates this smell so don't do a hot water bath with the cap on if you care about that. You will NEVER be able to get the last .2g of dist out of these jars unless you rinse with ethanol but that is an issue encountered with every small jar I've bought of d8 (with the exception of the legendary green rush 6.5g jars which are the GOAT for d8.) Overall if they bought/used a label maker for their products 95% of their package issues would be fixed but we all know that takes time which would have delayed orders even worse than they already were. 

Product: 5/5 

Ima be real with you... its good...  like almost cannaclear good... I actually realized while comparing lab results that cannaclear and MD both have labs from altitude labs showing near the same results, same with Denex. I'd be shocked if the 3 had different suppliers, at the very least they are likely purchasing product from the same extractor. They all have different batches/labs up rn but I wouldn't be surprised, with a little digging, if I found out they all used the same source. With that being said cannaclear distillate is better imo because it's less oxidized, less taste, and a trustworthy source... HOWEVER the potency is nearly indistinguishable if I'm being honest. The CBG is legit, the hemp gummies worked well, I got a little disposable pen thrown in with my order that seems fine but I wont touch it without seing a heavy metals report on the cartridge. None of my jars of d8 weighed the same. Most were on point within .05g but 2 were short roughly .15g and 3 or 4 were over by between .15g and .7g. Overall I got roughly 1.5g more than I paid for in total. CBG was exactly 1g, isolate a little over 1g. I received the correct amount of products. 

Ethics: 2.5/5 

This company has made some questionable business decisions that I believe fall into the moral grey area. They paid for reviews, were very rude to people who disagreed with them or asked for help with missing items, allowed people to jump in line by paying extra shipping, and to this day make posts about our community on facebook calling us clowns for pointing out their bulshit. Now you may be asking yourself ""Betterdaze why would you give them a 2.5/5 if they are acting like such dicks?"" Well my friends the answer is simple, they actually shipped the orders. Actions speak louder than words, they can moan about our community as much as they want but at the end of the day they begrudgingly accepted they had to close shop to catch up on orders and did so. They haven't publicly taken responsibility for their actions BUT they seem to have implemented measures to tackle the issues brought up by me and many others. We will see if they continue to head in the right direction. 

Conclusion: 

This place is like the Waffle House of the delta 8 world. Should you walk into a crouded waffle house on a Saturday morning expecting the best service of your life? Fuck no. Do you expect to be seated the second you walk in the door? Fuck no. Do you expect your mug to not have a little smudge on it? Fuck no. But will you get a delicious breakfast at an affordable price after waiting what seems like an eternity? Yes, yes you will. At the end of the day you need to ask yourself ""Does the cheap price make up for their short-falls?"" Many will say yes, many will say no but at the end of the day that is your decision. I personally will not be ordering from them again until they prove capable of conducting themselves properly. I simply cannot rationalize supporting them with this many great companies available for a couple dollars more. With that being said, I recognize that times are tough right now and saving some bills is more important than ever. I will say this, they are not a scam, it is definitely real d8, and you will either get your order or they will refund you. If they still offer it pay with paypal (goods and services only) or a credit card in case anything goes wrong. If you are short on bills and don't mind potentially waiting several weeks you would likely be fine ordering from them.
