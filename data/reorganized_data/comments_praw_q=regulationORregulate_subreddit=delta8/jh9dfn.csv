In analytical chemistry, two compounds as similar to one another as D8 and D9 are very difficult to distinguish from one another.

There then is of course certain labs that know if they can interpret the chromatogram of your sample to read artificially high potency and compliance, that you will choose to test at that lab every time a client asks for a COA. 

Finally, if the producer does not have a standardized method of synthesis, or does not homogenize all their batches properly, there could even be variance of potency within a single jar of product.
