This sub is not to promote consumption, it is for harm reduction. Do not trust messages about ""trusted"" vendors - to date no one has provably compliant delta 8 distillate.

Gummies, tinctures, and edibles may be ""compliant"" if the interpretation of 7 USC 1639o is valid, but I do not recommend them until cleaner distillates are made/further safety assessments are done

If you read everything here and decide it doesn't bother you, then by all means continue on. If you don't appreciate deception and being taken advantage of, welcome.

There has been evidence of caustic irritants in the lung tissue of some EVALI patients by Dr. Brandon Larsen of the Mayo Clinic, but to date there is nothing concrete tying delta 8 products to any known harms.

That being said, the long term effects are unknown, and the anecdotes shared in regards to it's effect on the lungs and throat thus far have not sounded good.

If you decide to use delta 8 products, you should be aware of the risks. Do not trust marketers to make decisions for you regarding your health, safety, or legal well-being.

DO NOT SOURCE ILLEGAL PRODUCTS HERE.
