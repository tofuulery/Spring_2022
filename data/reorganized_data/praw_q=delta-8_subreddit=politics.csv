2,pl60a1,PoliticsModeratorBot,Discussion Thread: President Biden Outlines Plan to Stop the Delta Variant & Boost COVID-19 Vaccinations,"""President Biden is expected to address the nation today at 5:00 PM ET on the next phase of his pandemic response. The six prong plan is expected to include components on steps for schools, healthcare facilities, and private companies to take to mitigate the spread of the virus. In addition, Biden plans to require all federal employees and government contractors to be vaccinated.

COVID has killed over 654,000 Americans, and the more easily transmissible Delta Variant has caused a sharp spike in hospitalizations. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the nation is reporting an average of 151,500 new cases and 1,500 deaths per day.

I got my start in journalism as editor of The Downtowner, the newspaper at St. Johnâ€™s University in Brooklyn, New York. In 1971, I went to work as, first, a political action reporter, and then as desk editor of the Daily World where I stayed until 1989. The Daily World was the predecessor of Peopleâ€™s World and it, like the PW, traced its lineage back to the Daily Worker, founded in 1924

I was among the first in the nation to cover the election of Eddie Carthan, the first African American mayor elected in Mississippi since Reconstruction, and the failed effort by Mississippi Delta racists to frame him for murder. I experienced personal assaults, including a fire bombing of my motel room by the Ku Klux Klan.
During that time, I also worked to lessen the danger of the Cold War by organizing cultural and other exchanges between the U.S. and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), bringing delegations of well-known Hollywood movie actors to that country and cultural figures from there to the United States. 

In between my stints at the Daily World/Peopleâ€™s World I was a union organizer, organizing workers in Northern New Jersey into the UFCW.

...here is an eviction defense tactical plan penned by an ex US Special Operations tier one mission commander, pilot and mission planner that worked with Delta Force and Seal Team 6:

""This is going to get interesting. Will be working up some ideas for how this could play out. Let's start off with an assumption. This is Bloomberg vs. Occupy. One mind vs. many minds. The goal is to coerce him into changing his mind. Dissuade him. Get inside his OODA loop.

-Go straight for him. **Maximize the eviction's taint on Bloomberg's personal brand.** Personalize the protest/eviction by attaching the blame to him personally.
Pierce his shield of bureaucratic impersonality. Brand the eviction with the name: Bloomberg. This is/will be a global stage, use it.

-Confuse him. Lots and lots of Flash Mobs. Shut down bridges and major streets. **Overwhelm with volume/speed. Non-violent disruption.** As soon as police arrive in force, disperse and reassemble at new location. Bikes + Kids. Disrupt, disrupt, disrupt. More flashmobs = more disruption. As long as the square is under attack, keep the city in knots.

-Connect with more people than him. Best way to do this: Eyes in the sky. **Get a camera/cameras above Liberty Square. Stream the feed.** The better the quality the more impact it will have. It will play across the world. Think about how important AJs video feed over Tahrir was when things got hot. Better yet, get AJ to cover it and stream it.

If you have additional ideas, add them below. Good training in tactical thinking.

Hoisted from the comments:

The flashmob tactic was tried here in Panama couple of years ago by the SUNTRACS construction workers union, and with very small groups pre-planted all over the city they drove the police absolutely crazy. Police would show up at location A, mob would disperse immediately, two text messages and now TWO flashmobs would block streets at different locations. They never followed up with it (preferring massive marches to display force) but it worked very well and with much less people than #ows has available.

9,2s0bjn,King_of_Sulaco,Green Capitalism,"Environmentalist fall into two categories:

People concerned about harm to people and ecosystems:

1. Control toxic pollution.

2. Water quality standards.

3. Conservation of natural resources.

4. Maintaining soil fertility

5. Protecting unique fauna and flora.


These are rational people who consider costs vs. benefits.

And..

People who blame post-industrial society for all of society's problems:

1. Ban GMO's and pesticides.

2. Eliminate any form of energy invented after 1600 AD.

3. Eliminate the domestication of animals.

4. Eliminate all plastics or oil-based products.

5. Prevent large-scale agricultural production.

These are uncompromising fanatics who want to return to a pre-industrial Eden that never really existed by turning back the clock on technological progress.

NEW PRINCIPLES FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
 
1. Accept the role of the free market as the guiding force in human behavior and not state mandates.

2. Incorporate effective economic mechanisms, such as private property, profit incentive and prices, for pursuing ecological and biological protection.

3. Understand the difference between potential and proven reserves and the economic impact of technological progress on resource availability and usage.

4. Accept that externalities dominate all human activities and find ways to mitigate their impact and; that the price system encourages conservation and alternative resource development.

5. Abandon the risk-adverse, zero-impact mentality and develop a balanced cost-benefit analysis taking in account individual variations of tolerance.

6. Accept innovation for meeting standards and not dictating specific controls or methods for limiting pollution.
7. Understand the Kuznets Curve which demonstrates how long-term growth correlates with higher demand for human welfare and environmental protection. 

8. Understand how Moore's Law allows for future technologies to utilize fewer resources at lower costs over time; and how Comparative Trade Advantage enables free trade to conserve resources.

9. Concentrate efforts on protecting communities and individual human beings from direct environmental health hazards.

10. Understand that the greatest polluters are governments and work toward a regime that enforces pollution controls against government actions as well as private.

11. Understand the limits of energy efficiency on conservation imposed by Jevons Paradox.

Threats to Environmental Conservation

1. Public ownership creates a tragedy of the commons for forests, wetlands and grasslands.

2. Prior-Restraint regulation socializes the costs of environmental damage thereby encouraging it.

3. Federal subsidies of dams, irrigation and agriculture damaging wetland habitats.

4. Prohibiting ownership and commercial use of endangered animals hastens extinction.

5. Federal agency exemption from both clean water and clean air standards.

6. Illegal dumping on public lands due to sporadic public enforcement.

7. Eminent domain use on behalf of private interests for risky projects.

8. Public funded insurance encouraging people live in flood zones and coasts.

9. Trade barriers protecting water-intensive agriculture and manufacturing.

10. Reducing the effectiveness and quality of green products via non-competitive subsidies.

11. Draconian wildlife protection laws encouraging wildlife destruction.

12. Economic stagnation and recession increase tolerance of eco-degradation (Kuznets Curve).


How to Fix These Failed Policies

1. Privatize the majority of public lands and aquifers allowing for stewardship and conservation by private actors. Return National Parks to the States so that they can be better managed as smaller budget items.

2. Allow for industry to meet EPA standards by cost-effective innovation and repeal specific -control mandates and replace them with fines for violating pollution limits. 

3. End environmentally destructive hydro-electric subsidies that encourage aquifer depletion and wetland destruction.

4. Allow for the commercial trade in endangered species to create profit incentive for recovering their numbers and relax rules requiring scientific research for the ownership of animal by zoos.

5. Ensure that regulations for protecting water and air from toxins apply equally to the agencies of the federal government as they do for private actors.

6. Increase fines for dumping in public spaces while decreasing the total acreage owned by any given agency and let private owners have a stake in protecting those resources through civil remittance.

7. Repudiate Kelo v. New London, which allows for eminent domain seizures for private use and expand the ability for property owners and communities affected by rails, dams or pipelines to sue for injunctions.

8. Repeal FEMA and NFIP compensation for coastal areas, deltas and floodplains that are too risky for private development by market-based insurance estimates, saving money, seashores and lives. 

9. Repeal or greatly reduce tariffs and farm subsidies that protect intensive agricultural activities from market costs at the expense of aquifers and wetlands.

10. End all subsidies, tax-breaks and no-bid contracts for energy production or energy-saving products to let the market decide the value of green savings, increasing competition and quality.

11. Give property owners an incentive to care for protected species by justly compensating them for the loss of land usage under the rules of eminent domain for public use.

12. Support policies that are pro-economic growth allowing for greater demand for clean environments and a robust development of new green technologies.

11,3i1m8y,reddbullish,"Slipping one last one in under the Saturday self post exception. Due to Pres. Jimmy Carter's Cancer diagnosis it's worth looking at his Crisis of Confidence speech of July 19, 1979","Due to Pres. Jimmy Carter's Cancer diagnosis it's worth looking at his Crisis of Confidence speech of July 19, 1979. It would be nice if people honored him for what he got right BEFORE he passes away.

It is worth remembering that the country was experiencing a massive cut off of oil supplies from the middle east which woke the country up to the total dependence we had on nations across the world. You went to get gasoline and you literally had to stand in line for hours to fill up your car. It caused a sort of panic that no one had really experienced before since perhaps rationing in WW2. no one in the USA today has experienced anything similiar except perhaps after an earthquake and only for a short time.

It amazing that young people of today can experience the lessons of history first hand with a click on the computer screen.

You can see how problems were presented and perceived and who was right and who was wrong in the test of history.

Anyway here is the speech. It is for you and history to judge but the good thing is you don't have to do it based on the third hand judgements of others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCOd-qWZB_g

Carter made many mistakes in PRESENTATION ( and he was widely criticized for lecturing and shouting at the 
country in this speech and for offering a sort of doom and gloom ) but he was often exactly right in his analysis.  

In a way he was an Elon Musk of his time proposing massive solar panel usage and solar power banks. He placed solar panels on the White House and they were ripped down by Reagan when Reagan took office.

He famously failed to get the release of US hostages due in part because a rescue mission by Delta Teams failed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis#First_rescue_attempt Had they succeeded there is no doubt Carter would have gone down in history as one of the most kick ass presidents of all time. The result was no fault of his own. 

He also was responsible for choosing to fund the secret development of the stealth technology and cruise missles (drones of yestersday) that gave the USA air superiority of the next 30 yrs when the technology was in no way proven (but he was an engineer so knew its potential). But he couldn't discuss it without giving away a top secret advantage. So he was perceived as weak on defense because he didnt fund other older tech systems like the B1 bomber which he knew were made unnecessary by top secret stealth technology. This may be one of the most important reasons he lost his relection to Reagan because Reagan promised a huge classic military buildup to a nation that had been embarassed by a hostage crisis.

He had many faults but he was prescient and had uncommon honesty and wisdom. He was also one of the first engineer/scientist Presidents. He was a nuclear submarine commander in the elite first group of nuclear sub commanders put together by the famed Admiral Rickover. (although the press preferred to call attention to his families peanut farming business.) It was of course also an extremely hazardous and dangerous duty since this was the first time a nuclear reactor had been deployed on submarine to add to the normal danger of submarine duty. He PERSONALLY entered a failed nuclear reactor to assist in a dangerous cleanup effort. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter#Naval_career

And of course after his presidency instead of getting rich from business connections he spent his time building houses for the poor with Habitat for Humanity and secretly represented the United States under many republican and democratic presidents in negotiations when critical issues were happening around the world. Often the presidents he was representing didn't want it known they were using him because those presidents were afraid his poor image would reflect badly on them!

It worth reading more about him at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter

We learned this week he has cancer of the brain and its very possible just his treatment could shortly kill him.

Whatever his failures he reinstated honesty in the presidency after the first Presidential resignation in history and served bravely in one of the most dangerous positions in the military of his nation.

It would be nice if people honored him for what he got right BEFORE he passes away.

They both have been managers, flight attendants, luggage workers, and my mom was at one point a pilot. My mom recently was fired from Delta. Why? She was falsely accused of drug use, without so much as a screening test. Her compensation for 32 years with the company was hardly anything at all; her boarding priority is literally one step above a first-time flier. Her severance package was equivalent to about half a year's pay for her ($8000), which was taxed at over 25%.

She was, in actuality, paid for about 1/2 of the time she spent away from home. Benefits? None to speak of. The attendents are even expected to pay for their own uniforms, which run upwards of $400. During training, all future attendents are paid $260 a week for over 50 hours of work, including on weekends, which equates to roughly $5 an hour.
