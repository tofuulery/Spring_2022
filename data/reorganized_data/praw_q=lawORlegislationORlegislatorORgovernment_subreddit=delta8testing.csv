Delta-8-THC is the less psychoactive cousin of THC, or more specifically “delta-9-THC”. The only differentiating quality between these two cannabinoids is a double bond in different spot within their molecular structures. This tiny difference binds uniquely to different receptors in our brain that activate different effects. Users have expressed that the medicinal values of delta-9-THC seem to be retained when compared to delta-8-THC, however much of the ""head high"" is reportedly less intense, if present at all. For those seeking the medicinal benefits without any of the brain fog or mental impairment, delta-8-THC is the go-to cannabinoid. 

Sales of delta-8-THC products didn't begin to gain traction until the pandemic of 2020. It had garnered some popularity among marijuana enthusiasts up till then, but a wave of new users stuck at home during wide-spread lock downs began ordering all kinds of cannabinoids online, not just delta-8-THC. It did however quickly become the most popular alternative cannabinoid due to its mild effects and its availability in states still with Marijuana Prohibition. 

The new delta-8-THC market was immediately dominated by a company called 3chi, however it did not take long for word to get out among other customer circles of marijuana users and soon a new ""green rush"" began to take off. As with all emerging industries, many bad actors also threw their products into market, with fake or doctored tests, improperly and dangerously synthesized source material, and poor customer service & relations. 

To the uneducated or new consumer, much of the research afforded them by the internet is inundated with social media posts of extremely unprofessional vendors having public meltdowns(ahem, reddit, ahem), among other viral stories with troves of misinformation attached to them. This provides a challenge for emerging companies who are committed to doing everything ""by the book"", since the playing field up to this point has been filled with landmines, bad practices, and disgruntled/untrusting customers. 

The best remedy for circumventing this current state of the industry will be educational marketing that provides important answers to questions many customers will have and be fearful of after reading whatever other misinformation they were exposed to. Until some regulations provide barriers to entry that ""weed out"" vendors with unacceptable and damaging business practices, we will not see the more balanced and predictable market trends we're used to seeing with other cannabinoid markets. 

THE STATE (aka government aka Skeksis)

Part of the misinformation permeating the market comes from the incompetence & failure of our government bodies to establish clear and concise policy. Unfortunately, we live in a society where the people that know the least about a topic are the ones passing law. 

The analog act of 1986 was passed with the intention of classifying substances that are chemically similar with schedule one drugs as schedule one drugs themselves, but only if they were packaged and labeled for human consumption. When synthetic cannabinoids, like JWH018, ab-fubinica and ur-144 to name a few (of several hundred) started turning up at hole-in-the-wall smoke shops across the nation around 2008, they were able to be sold without consequence due to clear “potpourri” and “not intended for human consumption” being printed on the packaging. 

Most of the chemicals used for this “fake weed” were invented decades prior and were used for research purposes only. A lot of the synthetic cannabinoids weren’t even based on THC; however they would still cause a reaction and oftentimes strong side effects as well. Synthetic cannabinoids are essentially any substance or chemical that act on the body's endocannabinoid receptors. In 2010, the DEA used emergency powers to control these products despite their legally abiding language, and in 2012 a law was passed banning synthetic cannabinoids specifically. 

The synthetic cannabinoids in question have never been a part of the cannabis sativa plant and have no organic presence in the natural world. JWH was indicated to be the culprit of the death of a 19 year old university student in 2011 which swiftly pressured congress to pass legislation making such chemicals specifically scheduled regardless of their packaging claims. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, “hemp” is defined as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all DERIVATIVES, EXTRACTS, cannabinoids, ISOMERS, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Congress *undeniably* granted delta-8-THC protections under federal law and is considered a derivative, extract and isomer of the CBD extracted from hemp and that is the most used commercially. The CSA (controlled substances act) schedules all tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols found in hemp, as controlled substances. 

Due to the language of the analog act & its 2012 update, this also includes synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols. Confusion and chaos has erupted in the industry due to the similarities in definitions of both synthetic cannabinoids and “isomers” and what chemical processes render a material “inorganic” regardless of where the material originated. These legal definitions fortunately provided protection for the commercial production of delta-8-thc products; however the lack of concise language also leaves a legal ""gray area"" that opponents will exploit in order to stall or stifle the commercial viability of delta-8-THC in any way possible. The 2018 Farm Bill expressly permits “all derivatives” and “extracts” from the hemp plant; however, those words are not clearly defined in the 2018 Farm Bill. One could certainly argue that through the chemical conversion of CBD, delta-8-THC is a “derivative” of hemp. To claim that such a conversion renders the material ""synthetic"" thus changing it's legal standing to a scheduled THC is what the DEA indirectly attempted to do by passing their interim rule. They stated ""all synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols"" remain schedule 1 substances. 

As we know, synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols are chemical compounds such as JWH018 that were sprayed on ""organic matter"" and sold as legal fake weed, aka ""s pice"" or ""k 2"". These chemicals had a wide range of negative and bizarre side effects, and were NEVER at any time part of any cannabis plant or occurred naturally anywhere at any time. This is not the same, nor is it comparable to, delta-8-THC, a cannabinoid that is already naturally occurring, and the process of converting CBD crude, distillate or isolate into delta-8-THC does not render it a synthetic. Furthermore, no method of extraction or *synthesis* was ever defined, let alone forbidden or banned in the legislation, so claiming that such processes to commercially produce a naturally occurring cannabinoid found in hemp are somehow illegal is *ridiculous*.

Certainly, the same scope of the definition of such an analog or synthetic cannabinoid is incomparable to the definition of delta-8-THC, especially while more recent and specific language in the new law places delta-8-THC under legal protections. These legal protections extent to the rest of all hemp derivatives and isomers, so long as the original material had delta-9-THC levels below .3% on a dry-weight basis, and that the end product also does not exceed those levels. Bottom line, Congress needs to take responsibility for the policy they outlined. 

A recent letter from the House chair of Agriculture committee, David Scott, and House chair of Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, Sanford D. Bishop, was sent to the AG, Merrick Garland, and requested that the DEA, in not so many words, stand down. They asserted that the DEA could not enforce their interim rule and it was causing a mess in market. An excerpt: 

“Congress did not intend the 2018 Farm Bill to criminalize any stage of legal hemp processing, and we are concerned that hemp grown in compliance with a USDA-approved plan could receive undue scrutiny from the DEA as it is being processed into a legal consumer-facing product under this IFR. That is why the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of hemp was broadened from the 2014 Farm Bill’s version to include derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids.” 

Everyone in congress understands that attempting to classify delta-8-THC as a synthetic cannabinoid at this point is legally unenforceable (due to their own legislation) so now, as industry stakeholders, the most risk we can anticipate from government is stringent regulation, which will eventually benefit our operations since we are optimally placed with key players that are already leaders in their own fields. The farm bill will be updated next year and will likely fix what they did in 2018, word on the street is that delta-8 will be classified the same as delta-9-THC and sold in dispensaries.

I will personally gladly welcome any regulations because it will mean ""weeding out"" bad and unsafe product from the market. Those of us who genuinely passionate about cannabinoids rejoice when our customers safety is incentivized through appropriate policy. I will NOT, however, be okay with restricting access of normal hemp & CBD establishments from selling delta-8-THC. If ALCOHOL can be sold in gas stations, then delta-8-THC can surely be sold in hemp stores as well as dispensaries.",1639508982.0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8testing/comments/rgerdk/the_state_delta8/,0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x000002C5A8955E80>,,delta8testing,t2_hsiqmij,False,,0,False,[],r/delta8testing,False,,,0,,,False,t3_rgerdk,False,dark,0.83,,public,16,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},False,16,,False,False,self,1639580363.0,,[],{},,True,,text,,,,text,self.delta8testing,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>DELTA-8</p>
