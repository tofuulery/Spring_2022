On one hand if my d8 gummies have d9 I want to know because it will only give more of a appeal to my customers but if they show too little I may end up having more than the .3% legal D9 limit and will never know until possibly it’s too late and I am wearing handcuffs.

I suppose this is where it comes down to having a usda and DEA approved third party lab testing.

We are about to start our first production of D8 gummies but I haven’t decided on a good lab that will accurately report the D8 and D9.

Any recommendations? We will be converting our CBD extract into D8 with high D9 and using that to make our D8 gummies each gummy by weight will be about 4grams in size which means by weight we can legal safely have 10mg D9 and the product still be listed as less than .3%.
