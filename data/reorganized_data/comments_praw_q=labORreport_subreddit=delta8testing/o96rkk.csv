your delta8 should have full panel labs (potency, pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents)

potency should be 95% or above, everything else should say <LOQ

Ideally you also want a chromatogram reading.

Its best to send in your product to a 3rd party test after you get it as there is a discrepencancy between the standards for identifiying delta8 between labs. Like the other user said a lot of delta8 has above the legal limit of delta9, so if thats a potential issue, make sure your getting another test for it. Its also more ideal to buy the distillate product itself and make your own edibles, gummies, carts etc instead of relying on someone else to do it.",False,,,t1_h39ckfu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Follow this guide</p>

As far as reputable companies, I don't really believe any are. All delta 8 samples I've seen retested from retail purchases have been non-compliant for d9, purity is often lower as well.

Looking quickly at that site, it would seem that the COAs are reused(or at least are missing the brand name). The use of many different labs for different parts of the tests is also very suspect

The red flags for me right now are:  


* No one knows what else is in there.  If it's 99%, 95% or 70% pure - what is in the 1%, 5%, 30%?  People who work for labs have said ""we don't know"", because there aren't references to measure that stuff against.
* Pretty much every company has had issues with hot distillate. About a year ago, 3chi had carts that measured 19% D9 (https://twitter.com/schottlig/status/1294681718662848512)!  There can be variances within a batch, but wow, that is huge.  They're either not testing, or testing and ignoring results.
* The companies claim the potential to do large bulk and custom orders and quote weekly capacity. Their retail sales claim a single COA and batch number for several months.  It's possible they only make a single batch every two months, but that just doesn't make sense to me - unless of course no one is making it themselves and they are using an industrial supplier for the finished product.  


At this point, I just don't think it's likely any of these companies are operating truthfully or transparently.  No one knows what ""the other stuff"" in a batch of D8 is, and the tests are just suspect – all they show is that company sent over a sample on a date.  There is nothing tying the batch to the lab sample or end product, and no regulations whatsoever.",False,,,t1_h4cxjki,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>At this point, I don&#39;t think any of it is safe.
