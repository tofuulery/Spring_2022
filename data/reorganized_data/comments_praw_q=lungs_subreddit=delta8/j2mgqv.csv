They state that the SS coils they were using went out of production so they switched to nichrome. They do not specify what the resistance of those coils were, but that they continued using it at high wattage. It was also RATS we're talking about.

So it sounds more like they used a higher resistance coil which would have caused it to dry burn at high wattage, and they literally cooked the rats lungs.

LOOK:

Some 90% of chinese made coils are nichrome. If this were the answer we would have seen EVALI cases a decade ago, and we would have seen millions of them.

Why dig for some other answer? The tobacco control crowd were happier when the finger was pointed at vaping in general, rather then maliciously tainted THC products. That's why they then jumped on blaming COVID on vaping. Now they need a new excuse.

This is a case where the obvious answer is the correct answer.

EVALI popped up at the exact time that Honey Cutt and other vitamin e acetate diluents and dank vapes all blew up.
