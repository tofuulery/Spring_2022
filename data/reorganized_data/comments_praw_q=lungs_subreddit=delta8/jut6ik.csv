Carts filter it out a bit imo, and also help keep doses low (it's a lot easier to run through 100mg in a rig) but no matter what the congestion will pop up sooner or later. This congestion is how people end up with lung infections. It's just a risk you have to accept if you use carts or dabs. How much you use will effect this a lot. If you just use at night, you probably won't have an issue. If you use all day you will be coughing your lungs out after like a month.

The carts themselves aren't really a risk as long as you are using safe ones. Even the 'unsafe' ones probably aren't bad enough to cause immediate damage, but you also don't want to end up with heavy metal poisoning in your 60's because you tried to save $1.24 per cart by buying from China.
