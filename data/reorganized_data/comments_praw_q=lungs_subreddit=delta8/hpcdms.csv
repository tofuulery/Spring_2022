* Taking excessive hits/causing a blinker will be incredibly harsh and cause coughing
* High amount of THC intake, whether D8/D9 will cause impact to ECS.  Sweats, shaking, heart beats will happen

I've talked with people who dab D9 and they all experience the same symptoms.

Medicate moderately and safely.  Don't go all out because you heard it is ""less"" potent than D9 vapes, you'll quickly overdo it and experience negative effects.

Regarding counterfeit carts, I've been vaping nic juice for years and have purchased carts from Fasttech  (based out of Hong Kong) and from eBay (shipped from China).  Many folks say their counterfeit but frankly, all carts are made in China and rebranded and sold from different companies.  The bottom line is I never noticed a big difference between these ""grey"" market carts and some from ""reputable"" resellers.

If the ""juice"" is good but the cart is counterfeit (or unbranded) I don't think it's a big issue because all of these carts are made in China so you really never know what your getting.  Also, just because the cart is cheap, doesn't mean it's not a true ccell cart.  I buy refillable cartridges for a Caliburn Uwell off of Fasttech and they are the exact same ones (they come with a code you can type in to confirm they are authentic) I can get from sellers here in the states but for 1/4 the price.
