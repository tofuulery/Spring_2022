I decided to purchase 10DC in leu of all the weird positivity/negative polarizing reviews. The price got me as I really did not wish to spend more than 15-20 bucks to verify I was effected by d8. Although I’m sure higher quality products exist you cannot knock 10DC for attempting to fill the market gap of skeptics looking to try d8 without taking a high risk. ESPECIALLY during a pandemic. Those that say they would purchase 10dc if it was 20dc and had better standards - I doubt you would. There’s already plenty of other companies doing $20 1ml carts that are excellent quality. Mycbdhaven is one I can think of off the top of my head. You can easily find discounts there to get carts for around $20. D10 is in my opinion a necessity for those that are not able to spend much money on their medicine due to the pandemic. 

That being said I was a bit worried going into this purchase. I’ll preface this review by saying if you have d10 products coming to you, do not be afraid. I can assure you that it is very potent and indeed active. 

Let’s start with the packaging. The package for the cart itself isn’t bad at all, although it isn’t anything crazy either. It’s honestly higher quality than I would have expected for $8 a cart. There isn’t any information on the oil itself, however there is a logo saying it’s hemp most likely to indicate that it is federally compliant and comes from natural hemp. If you email the owner of 10dc I believe he can tell you the test numbers of your batch.

One issue I feel would not increase costs to address is the lack of a notice to LE. If LE were to somehow in the extremely rare off case snag the package there should be a notice to LE that states the product description, a description of the 2018 farm bill, and as a bonus a printed copy of the test results. This is minor but would be nice to have. 

Next let’s answer the big question. Are they really 0.5ml? They look half filled! I know how it appears. That is how it seemed to me when I first inspected the carts. I was slightly disappointed. Then I realized that I don’t have a battery with airflow for a cart and I cannot go to the store at the moment. I really wanted to try it now so I used a pair of pliers to wiggle off the mouth piece pour out the wax. At first when I poured it into the puck, all of the wax came out and it seemed maybe 0.25ml. Not enough for a 0.5ml cart though. But then I used a heat gun to warm the cart itself up super hot. After maybe 20 seconds of hearing suddenly an entire waterfall of distillate came pouring out from under the coil and into my little wax puck. It more than doubled the yield and gave me what appeared to be about a half gram or so of distillate.

The flavor on them both is very nice. I’m going to be honest, I’m 21 and have been smoking since I was 13 or 14. I have never been able to really tell the difference between weed flavors other than wow this tastes like it has a lot of terpenes or wow this tastes like burnt hay and cow shit. With carts it’s the same thing to an extent. They both taste like weed to me. Like distillate tends to taste. Just like any legit disty I’ve had in the past. The wedding cake has more of a sour under tone and the purple punch has a bit of a fruity grape kind of flavor. I think they went way too heavy on the terpenes though. Whenever you smoke/dab real terpy shit you get this “bite” deep down inside your lungs. I don’t mind the bite because psychologically it makes me feel like I’m higher. But I understand why some people can’t handle it. I’m good at suppressing coughs but I also know that when I fuck up on even a tiny cough you cannot stop.

The high. The high is amazing. For $8 I can get high multiple times? Like higher than I get off most plain thc bud? As high as normal thc distillate? The people that say this stuff isn’t as strong must be referring to the fact it doesn’t make you paranoid. There’s no anxiety at all. You’re just stoned as fuck, hungry as fuck, and happy. Everything is funny. Your hands and face vibrate while your eyes expand in your head. The only difference is it’s muuuuch calmer for me. It feels like what I always wanted cbd to feel like. Kinda like what indica bud is supposed to feel like based on internet descriptions (we’ve all smoked indica and still got paranoid asf) pure relaxation and no anxiety. I think the paranoia aspect of thc makes it feel much stronger because it can put you on full alert or make you much more sensitive to subtle changes. D8 feels like the weed you’d get that would just make you tired and happy. 

All in all I’m very satisfied with what I got. For what I paid if they just ripped me off I probably wouldn’t have  lost my mind. It’s still quality medicine at an affordable price. For that this gets a 4.5/5 in my books.",False,,,t1_g0lszeg,True,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>First off I would like to thank the awesome community here for all of their wonderful participation in this rare time of history.
