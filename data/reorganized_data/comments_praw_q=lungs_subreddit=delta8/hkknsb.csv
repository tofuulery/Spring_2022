I had to dig around for a kanger subtank mini in my stored stuff to try my jack herer on to see if it was the cart and it worked so it's the silo not letting it work.

Would be interested in seeing if you get the same level of coughing when vaping at lower temperatures with your Vessel from 3Chi. Also, perhaps you could try vaping 10DC in the Silo for cough comparison. This inquiring mind is curious to know. 

Iâ€™d appreciate it if anyone else that has vaped 3Chi, 10Dc, or other distillate on variable temperature settings would chime in regarding the coughing. Is there a relationship between the temperature and the amount of or lack of coughing?
