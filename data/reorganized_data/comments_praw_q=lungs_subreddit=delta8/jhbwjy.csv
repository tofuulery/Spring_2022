Hello and thanks for the purchase first.
 
There is a brief write up on this in description, but wanted to pass it along in more detail. So the bottles we are using for the 50 ml and 100 ml orders are incredible quality. They actually magnify the contents may be up to 100X or a tad more. So a few things going on as you gaze into the new found glory. There will be hundreds of tiny bubbles and those being magnified so much may make you scratch your head. The contrast, magnification, and back ground reflections can play tricks on your eyes.
 
Now that being said you can also see some of the lipids. We pride ourselves on keeping those in the material. These lipids/waxes are generally translucent and can not be seen by the naked eye usually. They can be seen sometimes with the naked eye if they get oxidized, but you would have to hold it just right and still very hard to see.
 
The lion’s share of the lipids and waxes get “winterized” out while making the CBD prior to conversion to D8. However, we identified two types (there are many different type) that remain with the material even after a standard winterizing process. We discovered them when they started to collect at the first cooler spot in distillation tubing after the collection globes. Like the crazy mad people we are we scraped some out and smoked it. We found it to be melt in the mouth sweet and were amazed – some kind of sugary lipid. I am sure many of you have smoked “sweet” weed before so in the most scientific terms I can muster – it is some of that stuff.
 
So we took the appropriate action with pressure, temperature, times, and volumes to collect that as much as possible into the D8 we make. Remember when buying our D8 you are not buying the highest concentration of D8. We feel those process’s involved to get D8 above 80% are risks we are not will to take with your health. They include harsh acids/bases and bleaches with complicated filtering requirements.  At the end of the day these highly refined products are not tested for those potential by-products used to manufacture it.
 
From us you are buying a simple distillation product like any other oil. Food grade alcohol is used as a solvent, but is not considered a solvent. The product used to convert the CBD to D8 is an accepted industry standard purifying clay that happens to be acidic enough (under the right conditions temp, pressure etc.) to do this D8 conversion. The clay (T41) is designed actually to remove anything in the oil which may be in small quantities and not detectable. This could be any sort of heavy metal or other potential contaminate.
 
Anyway back on point, as the material goes through heat/cool cycles the lipids attach to each other and grow larger. Under the magnification of these cool jars you may see these. I have attached a picture of the two types one oxidized (seems to have a lower tolerance to heat) the other translucent. The pictures are under 1000 x magnification to give you an idea. Yea our material will never be 90+ %, but it will be good stuff as many people have reported. Questions?
