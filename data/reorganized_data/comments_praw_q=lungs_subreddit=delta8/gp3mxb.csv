Or are you trying D8 for the first time and claiming your first time reaction to it is 100% due to something bad only 3chi is doing? 

Have you tried taking less, and smaller hits? Like maybe a half hit? You admitted you've gotten chest pain from D9 carts. The carts from 3chi are dispensary grade pure and very potent. It could be that you just get this reaction from THC (I get it too). The fact that it's highly potent shouldn't mean you should only vape this ""if you want to die"", it means you need less to get the desired effect.

In my experience, 2 full hits, especially the first time you're trying it, is far more than enough than what you need to get you very high.

Unorthodox, Eastern practices part incoming: In my case, I was able to fix the chest pain issue as I realized it was a build up of energy. As a long time practitioner of Tai Chi, Neidan, and Kundalini meditation I'm very aware of how inner energy affects my body, and what surges of inner energy feels like. These carts give me a lot of Chi (in Taoism) (or Prana in Hinduism) and if I don't direct the energy when I take too much, it can be uncomfortable. If you like, you could send me a private message and I can go into detail on how to redirect your chi (very simple process). However if this is too weird or complicated for you then I'd suggest just taking very small hits as it's very potent.
