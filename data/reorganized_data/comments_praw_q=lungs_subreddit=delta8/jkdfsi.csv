I have been vaping D8 sauce from puro cannagars (sherbert chaos) as well as Loud House distillate mixed with Maui wowie Denver terpenes, and I actually haven’t used any D9 since it got here.

I ate it at 4, and I think at about 6 it really kicked in and even my husband told me I “looked f****d”. My only concern was I didn’t receive any letter for law enforcement with their product, but I am happy with the effects. 

Your experience could be different, but personally it has really helped manage the same as D9 but with the ease of ordering online and getting it delivered to my house. I’ve also got some carts and tincture coming in from 10 dollar carts and Harbor City Hemp I’d be glad to give you first impressions of when they get here.
