I am so disappointed, and terrified right now, I already have anxiety and PTSD, and I have been using the Delta 8 as a focusing and calming medicine. Last Spring, I was a pain clinic patient who had been responsibly using opiods for 20 years. I had found D8 had reallyhelped with both my pain and also PTSD. Since it was legal, i had cleared it with my bosses, and voluntarily and without other assistance stopped opioids. I also was looking to change departments and was getting a permanent raise and position by transitioning from a contractor to a full time employee. When that happens I need to pass a drug screen within 45 days. So I was allowed to use any legal product in the state, and was changing jobs to get a nice raise. They don't care about medical THC by policy, and since D8 was legal I was totally OK and had cleared it.  I am now a felon having a small supply of cartridges, and smokable D8 hemp. I am a remote IT worker, I stay at home and don't bother anyone, and my job performance had drastically improved, hence my imminent promotion to full time. I was also in the process of applying to the Texas Compassionate use program because of PTSD, and now my good job is in jeopardy, and who knows about the T.CUP program now. Thanks Texas, I love you but your cannabis laws are unpredictable and capricious, and I was really doing well, and improving it feels like a huge step backwards for both me, and the entire state for rights and freedoms.

EDIT and Thanks! Good and kind folks of Texas, I truly and deeply appreciate all the good debate and input, regardless of if you agree or not, and I am also learning a good deal. I value all of the opinions and have tried to read and respond where I've been able, but at some point the depth of threads got too deep to keep up. I am headed to the doctors office and hoping to get a referral to T.CUP program if they can see me. they say they have walk in's and so I am assuming that includes cane-ins too.

EDIT EDIT--> Just in case anyone needs it: https://curt.dps.texas.gov/app/public/searchPhysician.xhtml

EDIT [the Last] I removed the reference to a medical condition as a comparison for the laws, it was insensitive. Sorry about that.

Epilog/TLDR: I am now, at least for the next few minutes, Texas's latest confirmed Medical MJ Patient. After my primary care physician confirmed my PTSD diagnosis, I had a virtual visit with one off the good doctors at https//texascannabisclinic.com/  and this afternoon my information is now in the database. Thanks to all who participated and especially to those negative opinions, bless your hearts, I understand you better too now.

We were both born and raised in TX and have been using cannabis over 15 years +. When we had our kids years back, We had to find another alternative and dove deep into researching the legal cannabinoids that you could use in Texas.

Ever since that, I’ve been using cbd flower, delta 8 thc & other cannabinoids. The thing I notice, prices were way too high at my local shops in town for just a g of really brown cbd flower or $40 for cart .

My wife and I always wanted to work side by side . So we finally went for it and we got our hemp retail license a few months back in Lockhart, TX. 

Our main thing, especially in TX is offer better pricing and help those that can’t get into the medical program for TX. I can’t believe that someone is charging 80+ for a tincture with hardly any thc. Since we sell locally at flea markets, we can be cheaper than retail store. 

So far, we’ve been bringing in products we’ve personally used & working with a glass blower from WA.

25,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fbefadafc40>,,texas,"Dear Governor Abbott,

As I know you are aware, the 84th Texas Legislature is currently underway, and there have been several cannabis-related bills proposed, one of which is HB 507. HB 507 would, as you know allow for possession of marijuana under one ounce to be punishable by only up to a $100 fine. From what I have read, you do not support decriminalization or legalization of cannabis on any level, and have stated that you will veto any cannabis-related legislation that is proposed. Why would you veto a bill that could potentially save and enhance lives? You stated that it would be because cannabis is a Schedule I drug, which means that it has a high potential for abuse as well as having no known medical applications. 

In regards to cannabis, both of these statements are utterly false. Cannabidiol (CBD), as well delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis) have both been shown to have medical applications. While CBD is primarily used to treat epilepsy, inflammation, and chronic pain, THC has a similar amount of medical applications as CBD. THC is used to treat anxiety, depression, and nausea among other things. However, in order to get the greatest benefit from cannabis, both THC and CBD must be administered together. When administered simultaneously, CBD and THC are used to treat symptoms of multiple sclerosis, cancer and chemotherapy, and many more debilitating illnesses. So I ask you again, “Why would you veto a bill that could potentially save and enhance lives?”

As for cannabis having the potential for addiction, you could apply that to almost anything. Technically caffeine is addictive, and the majority of people who consume it are addicted. Unlike cannabis however, caffeine has physical withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuing consumption. Alcohol is most definitely addictive, and substantially more dangerous than caffeine and cannabis. One other point I’d like to make in regard to the argument “cannabis is addictive” has to do with antidepressants. If someone has to take an antidepressant every day for the rest of their lives in order to function in society, we don’t call them an addict. We acknowledge that they take this medication so that they will feel better. Also, antidepressants like SSRIs have actually been shown to have the potential to do more damage than cannabis, damage which could be permanent. I have permanent neurological damage from taking fluoxetine (Prozac) for three years.

Let me tell you of my personal experience with cannabis, and how it drastically improved my quality of life. 

First, a bit of background:
I am a nineteen-year old woman who has suffered from epilepsy, psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, nausea and extreme weight loss associated with treatments for autoimmune disorders, and anxiety and depression for most of my life. I struggled throughout elementary, middle, and high school as a result of these things. I frequently missed school because I would have seizures, or experience adverse side-effects as a result of taking anticonvulsants to treat the seizures (which hardly made an improvement to begin with). I was ridiculed and ostracized by my peers due to my psoriasis, which in turn led to depression and anxiety that still plague me to this day. 

But then, after high school, I tried cannabis for the first time. I didn’t feel nauseated, and actually managed to eat a full meal for the first time in years. On top of that, I had the confidence to speak to people, a confidence I had never before experienced. I bought cannabis for the first time the next day. I knew I had finally found something that would be able to help me, but I was also terrified of the consequences of getting caught with it. I started taking between one and three inhales of cannabis per night, and began to notice the frequency of my seizures gradually decreasing. Eventually they stopped altogether, and I was able to discontinue taking the anticonvulsants. 

Another thing I noticed, which I had not expected, was that my skin began to clear up rapidly. Before that, I had never felt like I was very attractive, and had thus avoided most social interaction. However, once I started to see my skin clearing up, I gained enough confidence to actually be able to talk to people, and subsequently make friends. 

Despite the misconception that cannabis makes people lazy, I did very well in college. My quality of life had improved significantly. Then, this past January, I was arrested for possession of marijuana under two ounces; a Class B Misdemeanor for possessing a plant that helped me be able to function in day-to-day life. I haven’t consumed cannabis since the arrest due to fear of getting in more trouble. I was in jail of over twenty-four hours, and have lost every bit of confidence I once had. All of the progress I had made in regards to epilepsy has been reversed, and the psoriasis has come back with a vengeance, despite being on a medication that is supposed to treat it. I’ve ended up in the emergency room three times since January due to my epilepsy, and I am hesitant to start taking anticonvulsant medications again, seeing as for me, they ultimately did more harm than good. I have lost all of the weight I had gained, and am now underweight and have malnutrition. I also have crippling depression because I am too sick a lot of the time to get on with my life. I want to be a neurobiologist, but I can’t do that if I can’t even get out of bed most days. As for my criminal record, I am not a criminal. I am a woman who is ill and was trying to feel better. It frustrates me that I know how to help myself, I know what I need to do in order to accomplish my goals, but even attempting to do that could have serious ramifications.

So, Governor Abbott, I ask you for the last time, “Why would you veto a bill that could potentially save and enhance lives?”

From ""Book 1: Tell Me About the Colonists""

Karankawa
Who were the Karankawa?
	The Karankawa were a Gulf Coast tribe.  European explorers found them unsettling due to their height, averaging over six feet tall, practice of ritual cannibalism and body modification, and use of alligator grease, shark liver oil, and mud to repel mosquitoes. 

	We learn about the Karankawa because they were among the first indigenous “Texans” European explorers encountered when they arrived in the early sixteenth century. Everything we know about the Karankawa comes from accounts left by the explorers and later settlers, and those accounts primarily have to do with violent conflict with an alien culture, culminating in the disappearance of the Karankawa by the mid-nineteenth century. We know nothing about what the Karankawa had to say about themselves or the strange, short people who appeared one day in their homeland. Do we care what they thought? Should we? Is it fair to characterize them in our own terms? Like all history, Texas history is rife with partial assumptions, silences, false beginnings, and arbitrary endings. What we don’t know about the Karankawa might be more important than we what we think we know.

Apache
Who were the Apache?
	The Apache were a tribe that primarily followed the buffalo herds but did practice small-scale farming when the herds moved out of range.  Within an Apache group, all warriors had equal liberties and equal votes.  The chief retained his position only by retaining the support of the others.  As in later European societies, democracy applied only to men of standing.  

	Wherever one chooses to begin telling Texas history, one finds competition and conflict over increasingly scarce land and resources. In this sense, nothing “happens” in Texas history that hasn’t already happened and won’t happen again in the future. From this perspective, the story of the Apache as Texas colonists and settlers parallels that of other immigrant groups that, for a time, successfully held their own against competitors only to lose out to stronger groups that followed. When the Comanche appeared in Texas in the early eighteenth century, the blow fell hardest on the Apache. The Comanche drove them from the buffalo hunting grounds and changed their economic and social structure forever. In history, nothing is inevitable and nothing lasts forever.

Comanche
Who were the Comanche?
	The Comanche were another plains tribe that hunted the buffalo.  They mastered horsemanship after the first horses came to America with the Spanish and were frequently in conflict with other Native American tribes and the European immigrants.

	One might argue that modern Texas history begins not with European explorers and Spanish missionaries, but with the establishment of the Comanche empire at the turn of the eighteenth century. If we think of “modernity” in terms of technological innovation and efficiency, complex social organization, and military and economic sovereignty over geographic space, then the Comanche—not the Spanish, French, Mexican, Texian, or American—were the first modern people to dominate and control large expanses of Texas. Until well into the nineteenth century, the Comanche could go anywhere and do pretty much anything they wanted to do. When we think of the “six flags over Texas,” we might easily dispense with four of the six.

La Belle
What was La Belle?
	La Belle was a French passenger ship, part of a convoy under the leadership of La Salle, carrying colonists for a settlement on the Mississippi river delta.  In 1684 it anchored in Matagorda Bay where it served as a home for the colonists for months.  Eventually, the colonists moved ashore and La Belle sank in a storm.  La Belle was located in 1995 and excavated in 1997.

	Texas history is full of great adventure stories. You might say that Texans like to think of their history as an adventure story in which heroic individualism prevails against a hostile and unforgiving environment. The La Belle story certainly fits this kind of narrative, but like so many other episodes in the immigrant story of Texas, it tells us at least as much about the tragic consequences of colonization as it does about success or “progress.” When a group of French settlers set out to colonize the mouth of the Mississippi and ended up stranded in Matagorda Bay, they may have at first believed they were part of an epic adventure, but the sickness, starvation, violence, and tyrannical and incompetent leadership from which they suffered and died probably taught them something different about the virtues of colonization.

Bering Land Bridge
What was the significance of the Bering land bridge or Beringia?
	Beringia connected Siberia with Alaska during the Pleistocene ice age.  Due to low moisture levels, it was prairie land and the first settlers to America crossed it approximately twenty thousand years ago.  The Paleoamericans hunted large game, such as the mastodon and American elephant, with flint weapons and that they probably had short life expectancies.  Unfortunately, due to the amount of time between when they existed and the present day, we have little knowledge of their culture.  We do know, however, that they vanished around the end of the Ice Age when the plains turned to desert and the large game disappeared.

	Traditionally, histories of human settlement in Texas have generally commenced with the migration of Paleoamericans via the Bering Land Bridge. This is the way my generation learned it, and if we hadn’t undertaken to write these books, we would still think that the first Texans came exclusively from Asia on foot. In recent years, however, this view has changed fairly dramatically. A growing body of evidence now suggests that many Paleoamerican migrants arrived by sea, and that some of the earliest migrants may have originated in Europe as well as Asia. While Beringia may still be a starting point for discussing the progression of human populations in Texas, it is not the only one. Moreover, its significance and meaning may change as researchers find additional evidence of different routes and technologies associated with early human migration. In this sense, history is never settled and never a stable body of knowledge. If the “facts” change, we must draw new conclusions from those facts, shifting the traditional paradigm. We find ourselves in strange and unfamiliar territory—just like the earliest immigrants must have felt when they arrived here.

Cabeza de Vaca
Who was Cabeza de Vaca?
HYPERLINK ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvar_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Cabeza_de_Vaca""Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was the first European trader in Texas.  A survivor of an early Spanish expedition, he traded shells and pearls for buffalo hides and red ochre.  He was, at one point, enslaved along with the three other survivors of the ill-fated 1528 expedition.  The four men escaped and made their way to Mexico City.  He then wrote the first European account of Texas.

Cabeza de Vaca’s fascinating travel narrative of his improbable odyssey from one end of the North American continent to the other is one of our only sources of information about sixteenth-century Texas, and, indeed, of south and southwestern North America. It is a tale of “firsts”—first discovery, first impressions, first encounters with “indigenes,” first European history of Texas. But Cabeza de Vaca’s sojourn is part of a larger history of the violent Spanish conquest and exploitation (primarily of gold and silver deposits) of the so-called New World, which commenced when Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492. And even this momentous event is only a small part of the history of European dynastic and religious wars that became endemic in the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire. Cabeza de Vaca may have looked for gold, but he found a rich diversity of human societies, most of which the Spanish and subsequent colonizers (including some indigenous ones) destroyed. In this sense, Cabeza de Vaca’s story announces both an alpha and an omega, a beginning and an end, a genesis and an apocalypse. 


Stephen F. Austin
Who was Stephen F. Austin?
Stephen F. Austin brought American immigrants to Texas with the blessing of the Mexican government.  He worked hard to maintain relationships with the Mexican government and local Native American tribes.  In time, he established a sizable colony.

It is hard to imagine a history of the American colonization of Texas without Stephen F. Austin, the “first” empresario and, as Sam Houston called him (though he didn’t like him), the “father of Texas.” A story like Austin’s represents Texas history in its most dangerous and potentially misleading form: settler triumphalism, the Exodus narrative of an inspired prophet leading the chosen people to the promised land (and finding locals who must be exterminated so that the chosen people can occupy and develop the sacred real estate). While this characterization states the problem in an admittedly extreme way, Austin’s importance to Texas settler history must be viewed from multiple perspectives: the Spanish and Mexican governments Austin cajoled and defied, the indigenous people Austin and his settlers fought and negotiated with, the filibusterers, adventurers, bankrupts, and land swindlers who followed in Austin’s train, and—perhaps most importantly—the African slaves whom Austin and his colleagues believed were fundamentally necessary for the economic prosperity of the Texas colonies. Austin’s story could not have happened in the absence of the larger American history of the expansion of slavery. In this sense, Texas owes its very existence to African slaves; Austin was merely the instrument that planted them here.

Fredonia
What was Fredonia?
	The Republic of Fredonia was a rebellion over land titles by a small number of Texians in 1824. 

	This obscure episode in American and Texas history still resonates in Nacogdoches and East Texas and presents a wonderful example of the living local history of hundreds of communities in our state. But why does deserve special mention in a Texas story that is already so crowded as to leave no space for dozens of similar stories? Fredonia illustrates the difficulty of evaluating events and their historical significance, and its inclusion in this history is based on its graphic demonstration of the primary motives of early American immigrants (and maybe contemporary ones as well) to Texas. Land fever, later idealized and codified in the concept of “Manifest Destiny,” ran rampant in the young United States, and the opening of Texas to American settlers put millions of acres of new real estate on the market. Getting good title to those lands, whether by hook or by crook, meant the potential for great wealth, but it also carried great risk—and the specter of a sudden and violent death. The brief history of the Fredonian Republic dramatizes the inextricable relationship between the American concept of “freedom” with the American desire for property. When history talks about freedom, it is important to know the fine print that comes along with it.

El Camino Real
What was El Camino Real?
	The Spanish were alarmed by French presence in Texas.  They built a series of missions and forts along El Camino Real as a deterrent to continued French colonization.  The most important of these became the presidio at San Antonio de Bexar (the Alamo).

	The Spanish mission-building phase of Texas history can be viewed as part of the “civilizing” process of European colonization. Advocates of Spanish colonization touted the conversion of native “savages” to Catholicism as a Christian duty. But Bibles tend to come with swords attached, and the Spanish missions along the El Camino Real were fortified defenses, complete with detachments of soldiers whose duties included the pacification of local indigenous people the Spanish sought to enslave. Unsurprisingly, very few Native Americans became sincere Catholics (or any other kind of Christian) or willing converts to European modes of settlement. Rather, the missions emblematize the abject failure of Spain to colonize Texas at all, much less to make it an effective outwork against French, British, or American encroachment. They also demonstrate that colonizers always justify imposing their ways on indigenous peoples by claiming to “civilize” them and “improve” their lives. Most folks don’t like being told what to do, much less that they need “civilization” or “improvement.” History may deal in facts, but it also deals in ideologies. 

April 6, 1813
What happened April 6, 1813?
On April 6, 1813 Texas declared its independence from Spain.  This move was in response to Mexico and Texas’ displeasure over Spain’s demand for money in order to help finance a costly war against Napoleon.  This rebellion was swiftly crushed.

Accounts of Texas history tend to emphasize the declaration of independence of March 2, 1836 as a fundamental turning point in Texas history, but it can be argued that the declaration of April 6, 1813 possesses at least as much historical significance as the later American one. We often gloss over the fact that Spanish and Mexican settlers, some of whom later called themselves “Tejanos,” had their own independence movement that both pre- and post-dated the brief but momentous American experience of 1820-1845. Texas history cannot be told without reference to the much larger narrative of Mexico’s national struggle for independence from European (Spanish, English, or French) and American domination, and to the story of Mexico’s emergence as a modern nation state. In a crucial sense, Mexican history determines and shapes Texas history as much as European and American history do, and the relationship between these historical entities has never been important than it is today.",t2_dg3qv,False,,0,False,Texas History Facts (Helpful for Educators and Homeschoolers),[],r/texas,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_1ofjxs,False,dark,0.33,,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,public,1381766135.0,text,6,,,text,self.texas,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This information can be found in a great kids&#39; history book series I recently came across called &quot;For the Love of Texas&quot; that is entertaining and humorous as well as educational.

La Belle was located in 1995 and excavated in 1997.</p>

<pre><code>Texas history is full of great adventure stories. You might say that Texans like to think of their history as an adventure story in which heroic individualism prevails against a hostile and unforgiving environment. The La Belle story certainly fits this kind of narrative, but like so many other episodes in the immigrant story of Texas, it tells us at least as much about the tragic consequences of colonization as it does about success or “progress.” When a group of French settlers set out to colonize the mouth of the Mississippi and ended up stranded in Matagorda Bay, they may have at first believed they were part of an epic adventure, but the sickness, starvation, violence, and tyrannical and incompetent leadership from which they suffered and died probably taught them something different about the virtues of colonization.

<p>Bering Land Bridge
What was the significance of the Bering land bridge or Beringia?
    Beringia connected Siberia with Alaska during the Pleistocene ice age.  Due to low moisture levels, it was prairie land and the first settlers to America crossed it approximately twenty thousand years ago.  The Paleoamericans hunted large game, such as the mastodon and American elephant, with flint weapons and that they probably had short life expectancies.  Unfortunately, due to the amount of time between when they existed and the present day, we have little knowledge of their culture.  We do know, however, that they vanished around the end of the Ice Age when the plains turned to desert and the large game disappeared.</p>

<pre><code>Traditionally, histories of human settlement in Texas have generally commenced with the migration of Paleoamericans via the Bering Land Bridge. This is the way my generation learned it, and if we hadn’t undertaken to write these books, we would still think that the first Texans came exclusively from Asia on foot. In recent years, however, this view has changed fairly dramatically. A growing body of evidence now suggests that many Paleoamerican migrants arrived by sea, and that some of the earliest migrants may have originated in Europe as well as Asia. While Beringia may still be a starting point for discussing the progression of human populations in Texas, it is not the only one. Moreover, its significance and meaning may change as researchers find additional evidence of different routes and technologies associated with early human migration. In this sense, history is never settled and never a stable body of knowledge. If the “facts” change, we must draw new conclusions from those facts, shifting the traditional paradigm. We find ourselves in strange and unfamiliar territory—just like the earliest immigrants must have felt when they arrived here.

<p>Cabeza de Vaca
Who was Cabeza de Vaca?
HYPERLINK &quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvar_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Cabeza_de_Vaca%22%C3%81lvar"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvar_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Cabeza_de_Vaca&quot;Álvar</a> Núñez Cabeza de Vaca was the first European trader in Texas.  A survivor of an early Spanish expedition, he traded shells and pearls for buffalo hides and red ochre.  He was, at one point, enslaved along with the three other survivors of the ill-fated 1528 expedition.  The four men escaped and made their way to Mexico City.  He then wrote the first European account of Texas.</p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca’s fascinating travel narrative of his improbable odyssey from one end of the North American continent to the other is one of our only sources of information about sixteenth-century Texas, and, indeed, of south and southwestern North America. It is a tale of “firsts”—first discovery, first impressions, first encounters with “indigenes,” first European history of Texas. But Cabeza de Vaca’s sojourn is part of a larger history of the violent Spanish conquest and exploitation (primarily of gold and silver deposits) of the so-called New World, which commenced when Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492. And even this momentous event is only a small part of the history of European dynastic and religious wars that became endemic in the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire. Cabeza de Vaca may have looked for gold, but he found a rich diversity of human societies, most of which the Spanish and subsequent colonizers (including some indigenous ones) destroyed. In this sense, Cabeza de Vaca’s story announces both an alpha and an omega, a beginning and an end, a genesis and an apocalypse. </p>

<p>Stephen F. Austin
Who was Stephen F. Austin?
Stephen F. Austin brought American immigrants to Texas with the blessing of the Mexican government.  He worked hard to maintain relationships with the Mexican government and local Native American tribes.  In time, he established a sizable colony.</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a history of the American colonization of Texas without Stephen F. Austin, the “first” empresario and, as Sam Houston called him (though he didn’t like him), the “father of Texas.” A story like Austin’s represents Texas history in its most dangerous and potentially misleading form: settler triumphalism, the Exodus narrative of an inspired prophet leading the chosen people to the promised land (and finding locals who must be exterminated so that the chosen people can occupy and develop the sacred real estate). While this characterization states the problem in an admittedly extreme way, Austin’s importance to Texas settler history must be viewed from multiple perspectives: the Spanish and Mexican governments Austin cajoled and defied, the indigenous people Austin and his settlers fought and negotiated with, the filibusterers, adventurers, bankrupts, and land swindlers who followed in Austin’s train, and—perhaps most importantly—the African slaves whom Austin and his colleagues believed were fundamentally necessary for the economic prosperity of the Texas colonies. Austin’s story could not have happened in the absence of the larger American history of the expansion of slavery. In this sense, Texas owes its very existence to African slaves; Austin was merely the instrument that planted them here.</p>

<p>Fredonia
What was Fredonia?
    The Republic of Fredonia was a rebellion over land titles by a small number of Texians in 1824. </p>

<pre><code>This obscure episode in American and Texas history still resonates in Nacogdoches and East Texas and presents a wonderful example of the living local history of hundreds of communities in our state. But why does deserve special mention in a Texas story that is already so crowded as to leave no space for dozens of similar stories? Fredonia illustrates the difficulty of evaluating events and their historical significance, and its inclusion in this history is based on its graphic demonstration of the primary motives of early American immigrants (and maybe contemporary ones as well) to Texas. Land fever, later idealized and codified in the concept of “Manifest Destiny,” ran rampant in the young United States, and the opening of Texas to American settlers put millions of acres of new real estate on the market. Getting good title to those lands, whether by hook or by crook, meant the potential for great wealth, but it also carried great risk—and the specter of a sudden and violent death. The brief history of the Fredonian Republic dramatizes the inextricable relationship between the American concept of “freedom” with the American desire for property. When history talks about freedom, it is important to know the fine print that comes along with it.

<p>El Camino Real
What was El Camino Real?
    The Spanish were alarmed by French presence in Texas.  They built a series of missions and forts along El Camino Real as a deterrent to continued French colonization.  The most important of these became the presidio at San Antonio de Bexar (the Alamo).</p>

<pre><code>The Spanish mission-building phase of Texas history can be viewed as part of the “civilizing” process of European colonization. Advocates of Spanish colonization touted the conversion of native “savages” to Catholicism as a Christian duty. But Bibles tend to come with swords attached, and the Spanish missions along the El Camino Real were fortified defenses, complete with detachments of soldiers whose duties included the pacification of local indigenous people the Spanish sought to enslave. Unsurprisingly, very few Native Americans became sincere Catholics (or any other kind of Christian) or willing converts to European modes of settlement. Rather, the missions emblematize the abject failure of Spain to colonize Texas at all, much less to make it an effective outwork against French, British, or American encroachment. They also demonstrate that colonizers always justify imposing their ways on indigenous peoples by claiming to “civilize” them and “improve” their lives. Most folks don’t like being told what to do, much less that they need “civilization” or “improvement.” History may deal in facts, but it also deals in ideologies.

<p>April 6, 1813
What happened April 6, 1813?
On April 6, 1813 Texas declared its independence from Spain.  This move was in response to Mexico and Texas’ displeasure over Spain’s demand for money in order to help finance a costly war against Napoleon.  This rebellion was swiftly crushed.</p>

<p>Accounts of Texas history tend to emphasize the declaration of independence of March 2, 1836 as a fundamental turning point in Texas history, but it can be argued that the declaration of April 6, 1813 possesses at least as much historical significance as the later American one. We often gloss over the fact that Spanish and Mexican settlers, some of whom later called themselves “Tejanos,” had their own independence movement that both pre- and post-dated the brief but momentous American experience of 1820-1845. Texas history cannot be told without reference to the much larger narrative of Mexico’s national struggle for independence from European (Spanish, English, or French) and American domination, and to the story of Mexico’s emergence as a modern nation state. In a crucial sense, Mexican history determines and shapes Texas history as much as European and American history do, and the relationship between these historical entities has never been important than it is today.</p>
