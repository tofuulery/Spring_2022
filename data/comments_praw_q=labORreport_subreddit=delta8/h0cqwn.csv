D8 is safe?  Pure distillate that has been purged of all solvents is safe(or is as safe as D9 distillate).  However, just because someone got a clean lab report for some sample doesn't mean that all their production is the same batch as that sample.  This area is completely unregulated.

D8 is legal in NY?  There is a reasonable argument that it is legal, or let's put it this way, a reasonable person could believe it is legal.

Delivered to door legally?  See above.  Also D8 is hardly a priority right now for law enforcement.
