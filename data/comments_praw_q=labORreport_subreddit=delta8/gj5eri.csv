As an aside, when the body sticks that hydroxyl on the 11 position of THC isomers (d8,d9,d10), the double bond on the nearby ring isn't affected. So d8-THC would be metabolized to 11-HO-d8THC. 

Is it more potent than d8-THC? Probably. Is it any different in potency from 11-HO-d9THC? Again, probably, but we don't know for sure.
