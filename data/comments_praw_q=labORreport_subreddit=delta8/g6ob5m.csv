First, I have not yet received a reply from Cannaaid - this isn't to say that they'll never reply, I just haven't heard back yet. 

Second, I did go ahead and try out the GDP cartridge and I have some thoughts on it: 

It tastes very similar to a Phytodabs full spectrum CBD cart, if any of you have ever tried those. I don't have a ton of experience with cartridges, so that's the closest comparison I can make. It definitely has some terpenes added in, as the other vaping I do is pure cannabis oil from NY's medical marijuana program and that is thicker, more yellow in color and less pine-y tasting than the Cannaaid carts. I'm not saying they're cut with anything dangerous, but to me it looks and tastes like there's something else going on in the cartridges. 

Effects wise, it definitely feels like D9THC to an extent - I get a heavy feeling in my forehead/temples area. Colors are a bit more vivid and I was content relaxing in the recliner and playing PlayStation for a few hours. I didn't notice a lot of munchies type effects, although I started vaping around five and I usually fast during the day, so my first meal generally doesn't come until 8-9pm. 

It is much more of a body load than it is a head high, but not in a couch-locked indica kind of way. That's about the best I can describe it. And this was just from the GDP cartridge - I haven't yet tried the Durban Poison. 

Overall, they hit nicely - not too harsh. They taste a bit pine-y, maybe a tiny bit of lemon in there too. It's floral, but doesn't necessarily remind me of cannabis when it comes down to it. This was an interesting product to try, but if I'm being honest, I could really only see myself using these regularly if I didn't have access to other types of cannabis products. I live 45 minutes from the MA border in NY, where I am a medical patient, so I tend to get my flower from MA and my vape cartridges from NY. I do prefer regular THC flower, CBD flower and D9THC vaping to D8THC, from this one experience I've had. 

I will very likely continue to try it out, especially the Durban Poison. I'm hesitant to say it seems safe to me, because I'm not a doctor or scientist and I don't want to encourage people to use something we don't know much about. However, I will say that it didn't seem much different from the few other ""full spectrum"" cartridges I've tried that claim to be made from hemp, with terpenes added in. 

That's more or less it - it will be interesting to see where this goes, but if I can get a quality vape cartridge for ~$20 more from a licensed dispensary, I'm going to go that route.
