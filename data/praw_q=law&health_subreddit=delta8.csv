0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x000002C5A898E790>,,delta8,"Hey guys. This is a follow up post to my [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/delta8/comments/jawccv/was_cited_for_d8_thoughts/) one, wherein I didn't really give details unless asked, which didn't help anyone really. Especially because the one poster who was actually being helpful has deleted their account. Also I had went straight back to my CBD shop to buy some more because fuck the police and I probably cheefed like 1/4th that bitch so I was out of it. So here's my situation again, this time in full (maybe excessive) details. Apologies for the wall; this would be my first offense on anything so I'm peeved about this.

---
The ticket itself, the written citation is ""possible drug paraphernalia"". This charge could technically be true for a real asswipe of a judge, as the battery/pen/whatever I used to consume a store-purchased cartridge of Delta-8 THC could be used in exactly the same way to consume a Delta-9 THC cartridge. The difference here is that Delta-8 THC is a legal substance both federally and state.

As per Texas Health and Safety Code § 481.002(17): ""drug paraphernalia” is any equipment, product, or material that is used for the purpose of planting, cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, packaging, storing, consuming, or concealing a **controlled substance**. 

The police did search my vehicle and did not find any controlled substances. Only the single Delta-8 THC cartridge attached to its battery.

I have two problems here now.

First, proving what I had was legal. I have the receipt and packaging (from the CBD store I bought it from literally only 1.5 miles away). I know as a fact the officer would have seen this as he searched my vehicle. I think, though, they'll have to send it in to be thoroughly lab tested because the field drug test kit the officers had said it did have THC...and it did. The legal kind - but the test is either not robust enough/not new enough to distinguish the difference. Would there be any reason why they would not send it in for a lab test, and what could I do to fight that if they refused?

Secondly, how to argue that the battery I had was not paraphernalia because it was not being used to interact with a controlled substance nor could it have been used for that purpose due to my lack of possessing a controlled substance. In no sane world should I get charged for this.

---

I was initially approached due to being a ""suspicious vehicle"". I guess vehicles being parked in public parking at night - in a well lit lot - constitute as suspicious. Maybe not the greatest of ideas in retrospect. Awesome stuff at any rate for someone with a home life they're kinda trying to avoid but I digress. I had fallen asleep watching a show on my phone and was woken up to the officer's bright ass flashlight disorienting and slightly panicking me. Usual humdrum of ID and plate check and all that. I was kind of out of it, though due to having just woken up and in such a way. Then I was asked to step out and the officer performed a search, likely because I seemed intoxicated so that was his ""probable cause"". That was when he found my Delta-8 cartridge, confiscated it, and tested it.

I know it's a rule of thumb to not talk to police more than you have to, but I think I may have saved myself from being arrested. The officers on scene did not have a THC test kit on them so one of them had to drive back and retrieve one, which gave me time to apparently get some leniency from him because he noted that this could be grounds for an actual arrest. I knew the field test wouldn't have the correct result so I basically yacked his ear off about the 2018 Farm Bill and Texas' parallel state law and all that good stuff until the others returned. Once returned, they all had a properly lengthy group chat. I think they knew that I knew the law but they wanted to punk me out with something.

---

I think I have my bases covered here and am confident I don't even need a public defender here. I know the laws, I have proof this was purchased from a store in the same city, and a lab test will prove it's Delta-8. I do say public defender, though, instead of attorney because I'm not in a position to hire one. I had a misdemeanor years ago (my only offense ever, and since then expunged and should not show on records) and that public defender did a very poor job of helping me. With how much of a hassle that experience was, I have half a mind everyone was in cahoots and basically racketeering.

But as confident as I am, I want to hope that a public defender would get this case thrown out quicker than I could by myself and get this worry off my back.

Don't fall for the lies on the forum.   Delta 8 is still totally legal and the DEA doesnt even have to legally know where the hell I even source my Delta 8...  Sorry to the honest mods.  Last post, but I think it's fair I actually ask to have a link to a .gov source saying this. I will donate you all my D8 now and never touch the product or say a damn word on this forum.

I mean they are replying and downvoting and upvoting, but actually read the mods replies, they don't deny.   Really they are messing with a karma that is affecting 100s of peoples health for the better...   I wish whomever y'all are would realize just how shitty you really are.   Just as bad as the damn DEA at this point...    👌👌🤣

So about 4 years ago I quit smoking weed after about 5 years of frequent smoking (the last 2 of which I was smoking daily). I had to quit abruptly because the effects turned on me. I had a health scare which kind of triggered anxiety and the weed just exacerbated this. Every time I'd smoke my thoughts would spiral and I would think I was dying. So I stopped. I have tried it again a couple times over the last 4 years but it immediately triggered anxiety and had a bad experience. 

Fast forward to now and my wife's friend offered me a THC cart. I though why not. It's been about a year since the last time I tried. I asked for indica because I just want to relax and feel good (I suffer from chronic low back pain). I also got a cart of CBD oil for the anxiety reducing effects. To my surprise, after 2 weeks of use, I've had no bad anxiety after smoking. Not sure if it's the CBD or the fact that it's an indica. It's been enjoyable and boy I have slept better these last 2 weeks than ever before.

The only problem is that it's illegal in my state. I read about D8 so I ordered some carts to try it out. Experiences are described as similar to D9 but less cerebral and anxiety inducing and more of a body high. Sounds exactly what I'm looking for.  My cart finally comes in the mail and I take one and a half hits. At first it was nice. My legs felt heavy and relaxed but then the head high started to ramp up and so began the anxiety and racing thoughts I'd experienced before on D9.

Anyone else find it weird that I get that with D8 and not this D9 cart I've been hitting? 

&#x200B;

At this point I'm thinking of giving CBD flower a try. I just want something that relaxes my body that doesn't take me to another dimension.
