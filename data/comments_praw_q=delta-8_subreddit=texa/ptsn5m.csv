>Mehler said the process of using CBD oil to make Delta-8 products is what makes it questionably legal because it can be derived from hemp or marijuana.

Uh, if something isn't illegal, it's legal. The entire point of D8's existence as a substance in Texas is to be derived from hemp, the process being legalized in the 2018 federal farm bill.

Unless Mr. Mehler has evidence that D8 brands are being derived from cannabis, or that D8 brands are selling product with >0.3% delta-9 THC, then he's just creating FUD (fear uncertainty doubt).

It's worth noting that there are actually cannabis lobbying organizations fighting d8 because it could adversely impact their business opportunities in Texas long term.
