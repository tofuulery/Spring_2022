And it also goes beyond just differentiating Delta-8/CBD from weed for possession charges. Drug tests for marijuana will also show up as positive, even if the individual tested has only ever used Delta 8.

We literally have to basically re-evaluate how marijuana and Delta 8 is treated from probable cause, to ticketing, to arresting, to drug testing and guess who isn't going to be given the benefit of the doubt in the meantime.
