This stuff is made from cbd, and occurs naturally in very small quantities, so it isn’t synthetic, but it isn’t exactly natural.  I kind of consider it like lab-created diamonds, there are potentially higher quality alternatives (D9 distillate in this analogy), but they are harder to find and more costly. 

You should consider that tolerance seems to build much quicker with D8, leading some redditors to consumer upwards of a gram a day, still never getting quite where they want to be.  You might consider adding cbd/cbg mixed carts to your rotation, as they can help you feel the calm, ease muscle pain, and relax you, and they won’t mess with you d8 tolerance. 

Lastly, you might consider getting a dab pen like the Terp Pen, or maybe something bigger like a DTV4, for the days that you want to soar.  Seems like most people feel the effects of dabs much more acutely than hitting a cart, plus you have the benefit of getting a ton of disty for a much cheaper price.  Granted, right now the sales are better than normal due to Cyber Monday/Week, but you can find a zip of the disty for $80, which is obviously equal to 28 full gram carts.  You then also have material that you can immediately add to food and create an edible like the best you’ll find in a rec state. 

Good luck on your exploration, start small and slow, and remember what the Guide says, always know where your towel is.
