As for taste and hit  there is definitely a taste that I can't put a name to that'll hit your lungs pretty harshly similar to 3chis vapes. So far would definitely go for 3chi's pure distillate for vaping cause how there's no noticable taste and hits your lungs super clean. As for edibles though I hope it lives up to the last batch I made with 3chi. Now as for packaging and delivery. Came in a small brown bubble wrapped packaging so slight chance of damage upon delivery with this method compared to 3chis box but otherwise completely descret. Only downside I had was the extremely small container it came in. If heated it literally filled to the brim which left absolutely no room for error and also stuck to the top of container which is near impossible to get off with normal tools a non dabber would have. All in all for the price between the 2 definitely the choice for that but for convenienc sake would definitely go 3chi. Currently looking for other vendors for next re up and will definitely report back on the comparisons.,False,,,t1_fsdj2ka,True,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Now this is my first time with anybody besides 3chi. have had 5 hits and can say it&#39;s def a tad noticably weaker than 3chi&#39;s pure distillate I purchased last time.
